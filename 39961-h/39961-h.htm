appeared as Appendix <span class="smcap">ii</span>. in the edition of Browne&rsquo;s <i>Hydriotaphia</i> and
<i>Garden of Cyrus</i>, published in the &lsquo;Golden Treasury Series,&rsquo; by Messrs.
Macmillan and Co., in 1896.</p>

<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of Griffins.</span></h2>


<p>That there are Griffins in Nature, that is a mixt and dubious Animal, in
the fore-part resembling an Eagle, and behind, the shape of a Lion, with
erected ears, four feet and a long tail, many affirm, and most, I
perceive, deny not. The same is averred by <i>√Ülian</i>, <i>Solinus</i>, <i>Mela</i>,
and <i>Herodotus</i>, countenanced by the Name sometimes found in Scripture,
and was an Hieroglyphick of the Egyptians.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding we find most diligent enquirers to be of a contrary
assertion. For beside that <i>Albertus</i> and <i>Pliny</i> have disallowed it,
the learned <i>Aldrovandus</i> hath in a large discourse rejected it;
<i>Mathias Michovius</i> who writ of those Northern parts wherein men place
these Griffins, hath positively concluded against it; and if examined by
the Doctrine of Animals, the invention is monstrous, nor much inferiour
unto the figment of Sphynx, Chim√¶ra, and Harpies, for though there be
some flying Animals of mixed and participating Natures, that is, between
Bird and quadruped, yet are their wings and legs so set together, that
they seem to make each other; there being a commixtion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span> of both, rather
then an adaptation or cement of prominent parts unto each other, as is
observable in the Bat, whose wings and fore-legs are contrived in each
other. For though some species there be of middle and participating
Natures, that is, of Bird and Beast, as Bats and some few others, yet
are their parts so conformed and set together, that we cannot define the
beginning or end of either; there being a commixtion of both in the
whole, rather then an adaptation or cement of the one unto the other.</p>

<p>Now for the word Œ≥œÅ·Ω∫œÄœÇ or <i>Gryps</i>, sometimes mentioned in Scripture
<span class="sidenote10"><i>Levit. 11.</i></span>, and frequently in humane Authors, properly understood, it
signifies some kind of Eagle or Vulture, from whence the Epithete
<i>Grypus</i> for an hooked or Aquiline Nose. Thus when the Septuagint makes
use of this word, <i>Tremellius</i> and our Translation hath rendred it the
Ossifrage, which is one kind of Eagle. And although the Vulgar
Translation, and that annexed unto the Septuagint, retain the word
<i>Gryps</i>, which in ordinary and school construction is commonly rendred a
Griffin, yet cannot the Latine assume any other sense then the Greek,
from whence it is borrowed. And though the Latine <i>Gryphes</i> be altered
somewhat by the addition of an <i>h</i>, or aspiration of the letter œÄ, yet
is not this unusual; so what the Greeks call œÑœÅœåœÄŒ±ŒπŒøŒΩ, the Latine will
call <i>Troph√¶um</i>; and that person which in the Gospel is named ŒöŒªŒ≠ŒøœÄŒ±œÇ,
the Latines will render <i>Cleophas</i>. And therefore the quarrel of
<i>Origen</i> was unjust, and his conception erroneous, when he conceived the
food of Griffins forbidden by the law of <i>Moses</i>: that is, Poetical
Animals, and things of no existence. And therefore when in the Hecatombs
and mighty Oblations of the Gentiles, it is delivered they sacrificed
Gryphes or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span> Griffins; hereby we may understand some stronger sort of
Eagles. And therefore also when its said in <i>Virgil</i> of an improper
Match, or <i>Mopsus</i> marrying <i>Nysa</i>, <i>Jungentur jam gryphes equis</i>; we
need not hunt after other sense, then that strange unions shall be made,
and different Natures be conjoined together.</p>

<p>As for the testimonies of ancient Writers, they are but derivative, and
terminate all in one <i>Aristeus</i> a Poet of <i>Proconesus</i>; who affirmed
that near the <i>Arimaspi</i>, or one-eyed Nation, Griffins defended the
Mines of Gold. But this, as <i>Herodotus</i> delivereth, he wrote by
hear-say; and <i>Michovius</i> who hath expresly written of those parts,
plainly affirmeth, there is neither Gold nor Griffins in that Country,
nor any such Animal extant; for so doth he conclude, <i>Ego vero contra
veteres authores, Gryphes nec in illa septentrionis, nec in aliis orbis
partibus inveniri affirmarim</i>.</p>

<p>Lastly, Concerning the Hieroglyphical authority, although it nearest
approach the truth, it doth not infer its existency. The conceit of the
<i>Griffin</i> properly taken being but a symbolical phansie, in so
intollerable a shape including allowable morality. So doth it well make
out the properties of a <i>Guardian</i>, or any person entrusted; the ears
implying attention, the wings celerity of execution, the Lion-like
shape, courage and audacity, the hooked bill, reservance and tenacity.
It is also an Emblem of valour and magnanimity, as being compounded of
the Eagle and Lion, the noblest Animals in their kinds; and so is it
appliable unto Princes, Presidents, Generals, and all heroick
Commanders; and so is it also born in the Coat-arms of many noble
Families of <i>Europe</i>.</p>

<p>But the original invention seems to be Hiero<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>glyphical, derived from the
Egyptians, and of an higher signification. By the mystical conjunction
of Hawk and Lion, implying either the Genial or the sydereous Sun, the
great celerity thereof, and the strength and vigour in its operations.
And therefore under such Hieroglyphicks <i>Osyris</i> was described; and in
ancient Coins we meet with Gryphins conjointly with <i>Apollo&rsquo;s</i>,
<i>Tripodes</i> and Chariot wheels; and the marble Gryphins at Saint <i>Peters</i>
in <i>Rome</i>, as learned men conjecture, were first translated from the
Temple of <i>Apollo</i>. Whether hereby were not also mystically implied the
activity of the Sun in Leo, the power of God in the Sun, or the
influence of the C≈ìlestial <i>Osyris</i>, by <i>Moptha</i> the Genius of Nilus,
might also be considered. And then the learned <i>Kircherus</i>, no man were
likely to be a better <i>Oedipus</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII_PE_III" id="CHAPTER_XII_PE_III">CHAPTER XII</a>
<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of the Ph≈ìnix.</span></h2>


<p>That there is but one Ph≈ìnix in the World, which after many hundred
years burneth it self, and from the ashes thereof ariseth up another, is
a conceit not new or altogether popular, but of great Antiquity; not
only delivered by humane Authors, but frequently expressed also by holy
Writers; by <i>Cyril</i>, <i>Epiphanius</i>, and others, by <i>Ambrose</i> in his
Hexameron, and <i>Tertullian</i> in his Poem <i>De Judicio Domini</i>; but more
agreeably unto the present sense, in his excellent Tract, <i>De
Resurrectione carnis</i>. <i>Illum dico alitem orientis peculiarem, de
singularitate famosum,</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span> <i>de posteritate monstruosum; qui semetipsum
libenter funerans renovat, natali fine decedens, atque succedens iterum
Ph≈ìnix. Ubi jam nemo, iterum ipse; quia non jam, alius idem.</i> The
Scripture also seems to favour it, particularly that of <i>Job</i> 21. In the
interpretation of <i>Beda</i>, <i>Dicebam in nidulo meo moriar, et sicut Ph≈ìnix
multiplicabo dies</i>: and <i>Psal.</i> 31. Œ¥ŒØŒ∫Œ±ŒπŒøœÇ ·Ω•œÉœÄŒµœÅ œÜŒø·øñŒΩŒπŒæ ·ºÄŒΩŒ∏ŒÆœÉŒµŒπ, <i>vir
justus ut Ph≈ìnix florebit</i>, as <i>Tertullian</i> renders it, and so also
expounds it in his Book before alledged.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Against the story of the Ph≈ìnix.</i></div>

<p>All which notwithstanding, we cannot presume the existence of this
Animal; nor dare we affirm there is any Ph≈ìnix in Nature. For, first
there wants herein the definitive confirmator and test of things
uncertain, that is, the sense of man. For though many Writers have much
enlarged hereon, yet is there not any ocular describer, or such as
presumeth to confirm it upon aspection. And therefore <i>Herodotus</i> that
led the story unto the <i>Greeks</i>, plainly saith, he never attained the
sight of any, but only in the picture.</p>

<p>Again, Primitive Authors, and from whom the stream of relations is
derivative, deliver themselves very dubiously; and either by a doubtful
parenthesis, or a timorous conclusion overthrow the whole relation. Thus
<i>Herodotus</i> in his <i>Euterpe</i>, delivering the story hereof, presently
interposeth, ·ºêŒºŒø·Ω∂ Œº·Ω≤ŒΩ Œø·Ωê œÄŒØœÉœÑŒ± ŒªŒ≠Œ≥ŒøŒΩœÑŒµœÇ; that is, which account seems to
me improbable. <i>Tacitus</i> in his annals affordeth a larger story, how the
Ph≈ìnix was first seen at <i>Heliopolis</i> in the reign of <i>Sesostris</i>, then
in the reign of <i>Amasis</i>, after in the days of <i>Ptolomy</i>, the third of
the <i>Macedonian</i> race; but at last thus determineth, <i>Sed Antiquitas
obscura, et nonnulli falsum esse hunc Ph≈ìnicem neque Arabum √® terris
credidere</i>. <i>Pliny</i> makes yet a fairer story, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span> the Ph≈ìnix flew into
<i>Egypt</i> in the Consulship of <i>Quintus Plancius</i>, that it was brought to
Rome in the Censorship of <i>Claudius</i>, in the eight hundred year of the
City, and testified also in their records; but after all concludeth,
<i>Sed qu√¶ falsa nemo dubitabit</i>, As we read it in the fair and ancient
impression of <i>Brixia</i>; as <i>Aldrovandus</i> hath quoted it, and as it is
found in the manuscript Copy, as <i>Dalechampius</i> hath also noted.</p>

<p>Moreover, Such as have naturally discoursed hereon, have so diversly,
contrarily, or contradictorily delivered themselves, that no affirmative
from thence can reasonably be deduced. For most have positively denied
it, and they which affirm and believe it, assign this name unto many,
and mistake two or three in one. So hath that bird been taken for the
Ph≈ìnix which liveth in <i>Arabia</i>, and buildeth its nest with Cinnamon;
by <i>Herodotus</i> called <i>Cinnamulgus</i>, and by <i>Aristotle</i>, <i>Cinnamomus</i>;
and as a fabulous conceit is censured by <i>Scaliger</i>. Some have conceived
that bird to be the Ph≈ìnix, which by a <i>Persian</i> name with the
<i>Greeks</i> is called <i>Rhyntace</i>; but how they made this good we find
occasion of doubt; whilest we read in the life of <i>Artaxerxes</i>, that
this is a little bird brought often to their Tables, and wherewith
<i>Parysatis</i> cunningly poisoned the Queen. The <i>Manucodiata</i> or Bird of
Paradise, hath had the honour of this name, and their feathers brought
from the <i>Molucca&rsquo;s</i> do pass for those of the Ph≈ìnix. Which though
promoted by rarity with us, the <i>Eastern</i> Travellers will hardly admit;
who know they are common in those parts, and the ordinary plume of
<i>Janizaries</i> among the <i>Turks</i>. And lastly, the Bird <i>Semenda</i> hath
found the same appellation, for so hath <i>Scaliger</i> observed and refuted;
nor will the solitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span> of the Ph≈ìnix allow this denomination; for
many there are of that species, and whose trifistulary bill and crany we
have beheld our selves. Nor are men only at variance in regard of the
Ph≈ìnix it self, but very disagreeing in the accidents ascribed
thereto: for some affirm it liveth three hundred, some five, others six,
some a thousand, others no less then fifteen hundred years; some say it
liveth in <i>√Üthiopia</i>, others in <i>Arabia</i>, some in <i>Egypt</i>, others in
<i>India</i>, and some in <i>Utopia</i>; for such a one must that be which is
described by <i>Lactantius</i>; that is, which neither was singed in the
combustion of <i>Phaeton</i>, or overwhelmed by the innundation of
<i>Deucalion</i>.</p>

<p>Lastly, Many Authors who have discoursed hereof, have so delivered
themselves, and with such intentions, that we cannot from thence deduce
a confirmation. For some have written Poetically, as <i>Ovid</i>, <i>Mantuan</i>,
<i>Lactantius</i>, <i>Claudian</i>, and others: Some have written mystically, as
<i>Paracelsus</i> in his Book <i>De Azoth</i>, or <i>De ligno et linea vit√¶</i>; and as
several Hermetical Philosophers, involving therein the secret of their
Elixir, and enigmatically expressing the nature of their great work.
Some have written Rhetorically, and concessively, not controverting, but
assuming the question, which taken as granted, advantaged the illation.
So have holy men made use hereof as far as thereby to confirm the
Resurrection; for discoursing with Heathens who granted the story of the
Ph≈ìnix, they induced the Resurrection from principles of their own,
and positions received among themselves. Others have spoken
Emblematically and Hieroglyphically; and so did the <i>Egyptians</i>, unto
whom the Ph≈ìnix was the Hieroglyphick of the Sun. And this was
probably the ground of the whole relation; succeeding Ages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span> adding
fabulous accounts, which laid together built up this singularity, which
every Pen proclaimeth.</p>

<p>As for the Texts of Scripture, which seem to confirm the conceit, duly
perpended, they add not thereunto. For whereas in that of <i>Job</i>,
according to the Septuagint or Greek Translation we find the word
Ph≈ìnix, yet can it have no animal signification; for therein it is not
expressed œÜŒø·øñŒΩŒπŒæ, but œÉœÑŒ≠ŒªŒµœáoœÇ œÜŒøŒØŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒøœÇ, the trunk of the Palm-tree,
which is also called Ph≈ìnix; and therefore the construction will be very
hard, if not applied unto some vegetable nature. Nor can we safely
insist upon the Greek expression at all; for though the Vulgar
translates it <i>Palma</i>, and some retain the word Ph≈ìnix, others do render
it by a word of a different sense; for so hath <i>Tremellius</i> delivered
it: <i>Dicebam quod apud nidum meum expirabo, et sicut arena multiplicabo
dies</i>; so hath the <i>Geneva</i> and ours translated it, <i>I said I shall die
in my Nest, and shall multiply my days as the sand.</i> As for that in the
Book of Psalms, <i>Vir justus ut Ph≈ìnix florebit</i>, as <i>Epiphanius</i> and
<i>Tertullian</i> render it, it was only a mistake upon the Homonymy of the
Greek word P≈ìnix, which signifies also a Palm-tree. <span class="sidenote15">Consent of
names.</span> Which is a fallacy of equivocation, from a community in name
inferring a common nature; and whereby we may as firmly conclude, that
Diaph≈ìnicon a purging Electuary hath some part of the Ph≈ìnix for its
ingredient; which receiveth that name from Dates, or the fruit of the
Palm-tree, from whence, as <i>Pliny</i> delivers, the Ph≈ìnix had its name.</p>

<p>Nor do we only arraign the existence of this Animal, but many things are
questionable which are ascribed thereto, especially its unity, long
life, and generation. As for its unity or conceit there should be but
one in nature, it seemeth not only repugnant unto Philosophy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span> but also
holy Scripture; which plainly affirms, there went of every sort two at
least into the Ark of <i>Noah</i>, according to the Text, <span class="sidenote10"><i>Gen. 7.</i></span>
<i>Every Fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort, they went into the
Ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein there is the breath of life, and
they that went in, went in both male and female of all flesh.</i> It
infringeth the benediction of God concerning multiplication. God blessed
them, saying,<span class="sidenote10"><i>Gen. 1.</i></span> <i>Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the
waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth:</i> And again<span class="sidenote10"><i>Chap. 8.</i></span>,
<i>Bring forth with thee every living thing, that they may
breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful and multiply upon the
earth:</i> which terms are not appliable unto the Ph≈ìnix, whereof there
is but one in the world, and no more now living then at the first
benediction. For the production of one, being the destruction of
another, although they produce and generate, they encrease not; and must
not be said to multiply, who do not transcend an unity.</p>

<p>As for long√¶vity, that it liveth a thousand years or more; beside that
from imperfect observations and rarity of appearance, no confirmation
can be made; there may be probable a mistake in the compute. For the
tradition being very ancient and probably Egyptian, the <i>Greeks</i> who
dispersed the Fable, might summ up the account by their own numeration
of years; whereas the conceit might have its original in times of
shorter compute. For if we suppose our present calculation, the
Ph≈ìnix now in nature will be the sixth from the Creation, but in the
middle of its years; and if the <i>Rabbins</i> Prophecie <span class="sidenote"><i>That the World
should last but six thousand years.</i></span> succeed, shall conclude its days
not in his own but the last and general flames, without all hope of
Reviviction.</p>

<p>Concerning its generation, that without all conjunc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>tion it begets and
reseminates it self, hereby we introduce a vegetable production in
Animals, and unto sensible natures, transfer the propriety of Plants;
that is, to multiply within themselves, according to the Law of the
Creation <span class="sidenote10"><i>Gen. 1.</i></span>, <i>Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb
yielding seed, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed is in it self</i>.
Which is indeed the natural way of Plants, who having no distinction of
sex, and the power of the species contained in every <i>individuum</i>, beget
and propagate themselves without commixtion; and therefore their fruits
proceeding from simpler roots, are not so unlike, or distinguishable
from each other, as are the off-springs of sensible creatures and
prolifications descending from double originals. But Animal generation
is accomplished by more, and the concurrence of two sexes is required to
the constitution of one. And therefore such as have no distinction of
sex, engender not at all, as <i>Aristotle</i> conceives of Eels, and
testaceous animals. And though Plant-animals do multiply, they do it not
by copulation, but in a way analogous unto Plants. So <i>Hermaphrodites</i>
although they include the parts of both sexes, and may be sufficiently
potent in either; yet unto a conception require a separated sex, and
cannot impregnate themselves. And so also though <i>Adam</i> included all
humane nature, or was (as some opinion) an <i>Hermaphrodite</i>, yet had he
no power to propagate himself; and therefore God said, <i>It is not good
that man should be alone, let us make him an help meet for him</i>; that
is, an help unto generation; for as for any other help, it had been
fitter to have made another man.</p>

<p>Now whereas some affirm that from one Ph≈ìnix there doth not
immediately proceed another, but the first corrupteth into a worm, which
after becometh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span> a Ph≈ìnix, it will not make probable this production.
<span class="sidenote15"><i>Irregularities.</i></span> For hereby they confound the generation of
perfect animals with imperfect, sanguineous with exanguious, vermiparous
with oviparous, and erect Anomalies, disturbing the laws of Nature. Nor
will this corruptive production be easily made out in most imperfect
generations; for although we deny not that many animals are vermiparous,
begetting themselves at a distance, and as it were at the second hand
(as generally Insects, and more remarkably Butter-flies and Silkworms)
yet proceeds not this generation from a corruption of themselves, but
rather a specifical and seminal diffusion, retaining still the Idea of
themselves, though it act that part a while in other shapes. And this
will also hold in generations equivocal, and such as are not begotten
from Parents like themselves; so from Frogs corrupting, proceed not
Frogs again; so if there be anatiferous Trees, whose corruption breaks
forth into Bernacles, yet if they corrupt, they degenerate into Maggots,
which produce not them again. For this were a confusion of corruptive
and seminal production, and a frustration of that seminal power
committed to animals at the Creation. The problem might have been
spared, <i>Why we love not our lice as well as our children?</i> <i>Noah&rsquo;s</i> Ark
had been needless, the graves of Animals would be the fruitful&rsquo;st wombs;
for death would not destroy, but empeople the world again.</p>

<p>Since therefore we have so slender grounds to confirm the existence of
the Ph≈ìnix, since there is no ocular witness of it, since as we have
declared, by Authors from whom the story is derived, it rather stands
rejected; since they who have seriously discoursed hereof, have
delivered themselves negatively, diversly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span> or contrarily; since many
others cannot be drawn into Argument, as writing Poetically,
Rhetorically, Enigmatically, Hieroglyphically; since holy Scripture
alledged for it duly perpended, doth not advantage it; and lastly, since
so strange a generation, unity and long life, hath neither experience
nor reason to confirm it, how far to rely on this tradition, we refer
unto consideration.</p>

<p>But surely they were not well-wishers unto parable Physick<span class="sidenote10">Œµ·ΩêœÄœåœÅŒπœÉœÑŒ±.</span>, or remedies
easily acquired, who derived medicines from the Ph≈ìnix; as some have
done, and are justly condemned by <i>Pliny</i>; <i>Irridere est vit√¶ remedia
post millesimum annum reditura monstrare</i>; It is a folly to find out
remedies that are not recoverable under a thousand years; or propose the
prolonging of life by that which the twentieth generation may never
behold. More veniable is a dependance upon the Philosophers stone,
potable gold, or any of those Arcana&rsquo;s whereby <i>Paracelsus</i> that died
himself at forty-seven, gloried that he could make other men immortal.
Which, although extreamly difficult, and <i>tantum non</i> infesible, yet are
they not impossible, nor do they (rightly understood) impose any
violence on Nature. And therefore if strictly taken for the Ph≈ìnix,
very strange is that which is delivered by <i>Plutarch</i><span class="sidenote15">De sanitate tuenda.</span>, That the brain
thereof is a pleasant bit, but that it causeth the head-ach. Which
notwithstanding the luxurious Emperour<span class="sidenote15">Heliogabalus.</span> could never taste, though he had
at his Table many a Ph≈ìnicopterus, yet had he not one Ph≈ìnix; for
though he expected and attempted it, we read not in <i>Lampridius</i> that he
performed it; and considering the unity thereof, it was a vain design,
that is, to destroy any species, or mutilate the great accomplishment of
six days. And although some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span> conceive, and it may seem true, that there
is in man a natural possibility to destroy the world in one generation,
that is, by a general conspire to know no woman themselves, and disable
all others also: yet will this never be effected. And therefore <i>Cain</i>
after he had killed <i>Abel</i>, were there no other woman living, could not
have also destroyed <i>Eve</i>: which although he had a natural power to
effect, yet the execution thereof, the providence of God would have
resisted: for that would have imposed another creation upon him, and to
have animated a second Rib of <i>Adam</i>.</p>

<span class="subtitle90">Of Frogs, Toads, and Toad-stone.</span></h2>


<p>Concerning the venomous Urine of Toads, of the stone in the Toads head,
and of the generation of Frogs, conceptions are entertained which
require consideration. And first, that a Toad pisseth, and this way
diffuseth its venome, is generally received, not only with us, but also
in other parts; for so hath <i>Scaliger</i> observed in his Comment, <i>Aversum
urinam reddere ob oculos persecutoris perniciosam ruricolis persuasum
est</i>; and <i>Mathiolus</i> hath also a passage, that a Toad communicates its
venome, not only by Urine, but by the humidity and slaver of its mouth;
which notwithstanding strictly understood, may admit of examination: for
some doubt may be made whether a Toad properly pisseth, that is
distinctly and separately voideth the serous excretion: for though not
only birds, but oviparous quadrupeds and Serpents have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span> kidneys and
ureters, and some Fishes also bladders: yet for the moist and dry
excretion they seem at last to have but one vent and common place of
exclusion: and with the same propriety of language, we may ascribe that
action unto Crows and Kites. And this not onely in Frogs and Toads, but
may be enquired in Tortoyses: that is, whether that be strictly true, or
to be taken for a distinct and separate miction, when <i>Aristotle</i>
affirmeth, that no oviparous animal, that is, which either spawneth or
layeth Eggs, doth Urine except the Tortois.</p>

<p>The ground or occasion of this expression might from hence arise, that
Toads are sometimes observed to exclude or spit out a dark and liquid
matter behind: which we have observed to be true, and a venomous
condition there may be perhaps therein, but some doubt there may be,
whether this is to be called their urine: not because it is emitted
aversly or backward, by both sexes, but because it is confounded with
the intestinal excretions and egestions of the belly: and this way is
ordinarily observed, although possible it is that the liquid excretion
may sometimes be excluded without the other.</p>

<p>As for the stone commonly called a Toad-stone, which is presumed to be
found in the head of that animal, we first conceive it not a thing
impossible: nor is there any substantial reason why in a Toad there may
not be found such hard and lapideous concretions. For the like we daily
observe in the heads of Fishes, as Cods, Carps, and Pearches: the like
also in Snails, a soft and exosseous animal, whereof in the naked and
greater sort, as though she would requite the defect of a shell on their
back, Nature near the head hath placed a flat white stone, or rather
testaceous concre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>tion. Which though <i>Aldrovandus</i> affirms, that after
dissection of many, he found but in some few: yet of the great gray
Snails, I have not met with any that wanted it: and the same indeed so
palpable, that without dissection it is discoverable by the hand.</p>

<p>Again, though it be not impossible, yet it is surely very rare: as we
are induced to believe from some enquiry of our own, from the trial of
many who have been deceived, and the frustrated search of <i>Porta</i>, who
upon the explorement of many, could scarce find one. Nor is it only of
rarity, but may be doubted whether it be of existencie, or really any
such stone in the head of a Toad at all. For although <i>Lapidaries</i> and
questuary enquirers affirm it, yet the Writers of Minerals and natural
speculators, are of another belief: conceiving the stones which bear
this name, to be a Mineral concretion; not to be found in animals, but
in fields. And therefore <i>B≈ìtius</i> refers it to <i>Asteria</i> or some kind
of <i>Lapis stellaris</i>, and plainly concludeth, <i>reperiuntur in agris,
quos tamen alii in annosis ac qui diu in Arundinetis inter rubos
sentesque delituerunt bufonis capitibus generari pertinaciter
affirmant</i>.</p>

<p>Lastly, If any such thing there be, yet must it not, for ought I see, be
taken as we receive it, for a loose and moveable stone, but rather a
concretion or induration of the crany it self; for being of an earthy
temper, living in the earth, and as some say feeding thereon, such
indurations may sometimes happen. Thus when <i>Brassavolus</i> after a long
search had discovered one, he affirms it was rather the forehead bone
petrified, then a stone within the crany; and of this belief was
<i>Gesner</i>. Which is also much confirmed from what is delivered in
<i>Aldrovandus</i>, upon experiment of very many Toads, whose cranies or
sculs in time grew hard, and almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span> of a stony substance. All which
considered, we must with circumspection receive those stones which
commonly bear this name, much less believe the traditions, that in envy
to mankind they are cast out, or swallowed down by the Toad; which
cannot consist with <i>Anatomy</i>, and with the rest, enforced this censure
from <i>B≈ìtius</i>, <i>Ab eo tempore pro nugis habui quod de Bufonio lapide,
ejusque origine traditur.</i></p>

<p>What therefore best reconcileth these divided determinations, may be a
middle opinion; that of these stones some may be mineral, and to be
found in the earth; some animal, to be met with in Toads, at least by
the induration of their cranies. The first are many and manifold, to be
found in <i>Germany</i> and other parts; the last are fewer in number, and in
substance not unlike the stones in Crabs heads. This is agreeable unto
the determination of <i>Aldrovandus</i><span class="sidenote">De Mineral. lib. 4. Mus√¶i
Calceolariani, Sect. 3.</span>, and is also the judgment of learned
<i>Spigelius</i> in his Epistle unto <i>Pignorius</i>.</p>

<p>But these Toadstones, at least very many thereof, which are esteemed
among us, are at last found to be taken not out of Toads heads, but out
of a Fishes mouth, being handsomely contrived out of the teeth of the
<i>Lupus Marinus</i>, a Fish often taken in our Northern Seas, as was
publickly declared by an eminent and learned Physitian.<span class="sidenote">Sir <i>George
Ent</i>.</span> But because men are unwilling to conceive so low of their
Toadstones which they so highly value, they may make some trial thereof
by a candentorned hot Iron applied unto the hollow and unpolished part
thereof, whereupon if they be true stones they will not be apt to burn
or afford a burnt odour, which they may be apt to do, if contrived out
of animal parts or the teeth of fishes.</p>

<p>Concerning the generation of Frogs, we shall briefly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span> deliver that
account which observation hath taught us. By Frogs I understand not such
as arising from putrefaction, are bred without copulation, and because
they subsist not long, are called <i>Temporari√¶</i>; nor do I mean the little
Frog of an excellent Parrat green, that usually sits on Trees and
Bushes, and is therefore called <i>Ranunculus viridis</i>, or <i>arboreus</i>; but
hereby I understand the aquatile or Water-Frog, whereof in ditches and
standing plashes we may behold many millions every Spring in <i>England</i>.
Now these do not as <i>Pliny</i> conceiveth, exclude black pieces of flesh,
which after become Frogs; but they let fall their spawn in the water, of
excellent use in Physick, and scarce unknown unto any. In this spawn of
a lentous and transparent body, are to be discerned many specks, or
little conglobulations, which in a small time become of deep black, a
substance more compacted and terrestrious then the other; for it riseth
not in distillation, and affords a powder when the white and aqueous
part is exhaled. Now of this black or dusky substance is the Frog at
last formed; as we have beheld, including the spawn with water in a
glass, and exposing it unto the Sun. For that black and round substance,
in a few days began to dilate and grow longer, after a while the head,
the eyes, the tail to be discernable, and at last to become that which
the Ancients called <i>Gyrinus</i>, we a <i>Porwigle</i> or Tadpole. This in some
weeks after becomes a perfect Frog, the legs growing out before, and the
tail wearing away, to supply the other behind; as may be observed in
some which have newly forsaken the water; for in such, some part of the
tail will be seen, but curtailed and short, not long and finny as
before. A part provided them a while to swim and move in the water, that
is, untill such time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span> as Nature excluded legs, whereby they might be
provided not only to swim in the water, but move upon the land,
according to the amphibious <span class="sidenote"><i>Amphibious Animals, such as live in
both elements of land and water.</i></span> and mixt intention of Nature, that
is, to live in both. So that whoever observeth the first progression of
the seed before motion, or shall take notice of the strange
indistinction of parts in the Tadpole, even when it moveth about, and
how successively the inward parts do seem to discover themselves, until
their last perfection; may easily discern the high curiosity of Nature
in these inferiour animals, and what a long line is run to make a Frog.</p>

<p>And because many affirm, and some deliver, that in regard it hath lungs
and breatheth, a Frog may be easily drowned; though the reason be
probable, I find not the experiment answerable; for fastning one about a
span under water, it lived almost six days. Nor is it only hard to
destroy one in water, but difficult also at land: for it will live long
after the lungs and heart be out; how long it will live in the seed, or
whether the spawn of this year being preserved, will not arise into
Frogs in the next, might also be enquired: and we are prepared to trie.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV_PE_III" id="CHAPTER_XIV_PE_III">CHAPTER XIV</a>
<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of the Salamander.</span></h2>


<p>That a Salamander is able to live in flames, to endure and put out fire,
is an assertion, not only of great antiquity, but confirmed by frequent,
and not contemptible testimony. The <i>Egyptians</i> have drawn it into their
Hieroglyphicks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span> <i>Aristotle</i> seemeth to embrace it; more plainly
<i>Nicander</i>, <i>Sarenus Sammonicus</i>, <i>√Ülian</i> and <i>Pliny</i>, who assigns the
cause of this effect: An Animal (saith he) so cold that it extinguisheth
the fire like Ice. All which notwithstanding, there is on the negative,
Authority and Experience; <i>Sextius</i> a Physitian, as <i>Pliny</i> delivereth,
denied this effect; <i>Dioscorides</i> affirmed it a point of folly to
believe it; <i>Galen</i> that it endureth the fire a while, but in
continuance is consumed therein. For experimental conviction,
<i>Mathiolus</i> affirmeth, he saw a Salamander burnt in a very short time;
and of the like assertion is <i>Amatus Lusitanus</i>; and most plainly
<i>Pierius</i>, whose words in his Hieroglyphicks are these: <i>Whereas it is
commonly said that a Salamander extinguisheth fire, we have found by
experience, that it is so far from quenching hot coals, that it dieth
immediately therein.</i> As for the contrary assertion of <i>Aristotle</i>, it
is but by hear say, as common opinion believeth, <i>H√¶c enim (ut aiunt)
ignem ingrediens, eum extinguit</i>; and therefore there was no absurdity
in <i>Galen</i>, when as a Septical medicine <span class="sidenote"><i>A corruptive Medicine
destroying the parts like Arsenike.</i></span> he commended the ashes of a
Salamander; and <i>Magicians</i> in vain from the power of this Tradition, at
the burning of Towns or Houses expect a relief from Salamanders.</p>

<p>The ground of this opinion, might be some sensible resistance of fire
observed in the Salamander: which being, as <i>Galen</i> determineth, cold in
the fourth, and moist in the third degree, and having also a mucous
humidity above and under the skin, by vertue thereof it may a while
endure the flame: which being consumed, it can resist no more. Such an
humidity there is observed in Newtes, or Water-Lizards, especially if
their skins be perforated or pricked. Thus will Frogs and Snails endure
the Flame: thus will whites of Eggs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span> vitreous or glassie flegm
extinguish a coal: thus are unguents made which protect a while from the
fire: and thus beside the <i>Hirpini</i> there are later stories of men that
have passed untoucht through the fire. And therefore some truth we allow
in the tradition: truth according unto <i>Galen</i>, that it may for a time
resist a flame, or as <i>Scaliger</i> avers, extinguish or put out a coal:
for thus much will many humid bodies perform: but that it perseveres and
lives in that destructive element, is a fallacious enlargement. Nor do
we reasonably conclude, because for a time it endureth fire, it subdueth
and extinguisheth the same, because by a cold and aluminous moisture, it
is able a while to resist it: from a peculiarity of Nature it subsisteth
and liveth in it.</p>

<p>It hath been much promoted by Stories of incombustible napkins and
textures which endure the fire, whose materials are called by the name
of Salamanders wool. Which many too literally apprehending, conceive
some investing part, or tegument of the Salamander: wherein beside that
they mistake the condition of this Animal (which is a kind of Lizard, a
quadruped corticated and depilous, that is, without wool, fur, or hair)
they observe not the method and general rule of nature; whereby all
Quadrupeds oviparous, as Lizards, Frogs, Tortois, Chamelions,
Crocodiles, are without hair, and have no covering part or hairy
investment at all. And if they conceive that from the skin of the
Salamander, these incremable pieces are composed; beside the experiments
made upon the living, that of <i>Brassavolus</i> will step in, who in the
search of this truth, did burn the skin of one dead.</p>

<p>Nor is this Salamanders wooll desumed from any Animal, but a Mineral
substance Metaphorically so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span> called from this received opinion. For
beside <i>Germanicus</i> his heart<span class="sidenote15">Suetonius.</span>, and <i>Pyrrhus</i> his great
Toe,<span class="sidenote10">Plutarch.</span> which would not burn with the rest of their bodies,
there are in the number of Minerals some bodies incombustible; more
remarkably that which the ancients named <i>Asbeston</i>, and <i>Pancirollus</i>
treats of in the Chapter of <i>Linum vivum</i>. Whereof by art were weaved
Napkins, Shirts, and Coats, inconsumable by fire; and wherein in ancient
times to preserve their ashes pure, and without commixture, they burnt
the bodies of Kings. A Napkin hereof <i>Pliny</i> reports that <i>Nero</i> had,
and the like saith <i>Paulus Venetus</i> the Emperour of <i>Tartary</i> sent unto
Pope <i>Alexander</i>; and also affirms that in some part of <i>Tartary</i> there
were Mines of Iron whose filaments were weaved into incombustible cloth.
Which rare Manufacture, although delivered for lost by <i>Pancirollus</i>,
yet <i>Salmuth</i> his Commentator affirmeth, that one <i>Podocaterus</i> a
Cyprian, had shewed the same at <i>Venice</i>; and his materials were from
<i>Cyprus</i>, where indeed <i>Dioscorides</i> placeth them; the same is also
ocularly confirmed by <i>Vives</i> upon <i>Austin</i>, and <i>Maiolus</i> in his
Colloquies. And thus in our days do men practise to make long-lasting
Snasts for Lamps out of Alumen plumosum; and by the same we read in
<i>Pausanius</i>, that there always burnt a Lamp before the Image of
<i>Minerva</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV_PE_III" id="CHAPTER_XV_PE_III">CHAPTER XV</a>
<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of the Amphisb√¶na.</span></h2>


<p>That the Amphisb√¶na, that is, a smaller kind of Serpent, which moveth
forward and backward, hath two heads, or one at either extream, was
affirmed first by <i>Nicander</i>, and after by many others, by the Author of
the Book <i>De Theriaca ad Pisonem</i>, ascribed unto <i>Galen</i>; more plainly
<i>Pliny</i>, <i>Geminum habet caput, tanquam parum esset uno ore effundi
venenum</i>: but <i>√Ülian</i> most confidently, who referring the conceit of
<i>Chimera</i> and <i>Hydra</i> unto Fables, hath set down this as an undeniable
truth.</p>

<p>Whereunto while men assent, and can believe a bicipitous conformation in
any continued species, they admit a gemination of principle parts, not
naturally discovered in any Animal. True it is that other parts in
Animals are not equal; for some make their progression with many legs,
even to the number of an hundred, as <i>Juli</i>, <i>Scolopendr√¶</i>; or such as
are termed <i>Centipedes</i>: some fly with two wings, as Birds and many
Insects, some with four, as all farinaceous or mealy-winged Animals, as
Butterflies, and Moths: all vaginipennous or sheath-winged Insects, as
Beetles and Dorrs. Some have three Testicles, as <i>Aristotle</i> speaks of
the Buzzard; and some have four stomachs, as horned and ruminating
Animals; but for the principle parts, the Liver, Heart, and especially
the brains; regularly they are but one in any kind or species
whatsoever.</p>

<p>And were there any such species or natural kind of animal, it would be
hard to make good those six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span> positions of body, which according to the
three dimensions are ascribed unto every Animal: that is, <i>infra</i>,
<i>supra</i>, <i>ante</i>, <i>retro</i>, <i>dextrosum</i>, <i>sinistrosum</i>: for if (as it is
determined) that be the anterior and upper part, wherein the senses are
placed, and that the posterior and lower part which is opposite
thereunto, there is no inferiour or former part in this Animal; for the
senses being placed at both extreams, doth make both ends anterior,
which is impossible; the terms being Relative, which mutually subsist,
and are not without each other. And therefore this duplicity was ill
contrived to place one head at both extreams, and had been more
tolerable to have setled three or four at one. And therefore also Poets
have been more reasonable then Philosophers, and <i>Geryon</i> or <i>Cerberus</i>
less monstrous than <i>Amphisb√¶na</i>.</p>

<p>Again, if any such thing there were, it were not to be obtruded by the
name of <i>Amphisb√¶na</i>, or as an Animal of one denomination; for properly
that Animal is not one, but multiplicious or many, which hath a
duplicity or gemination of principal parts. And this doth <i>Aristotle</i>
define, when he affirmeth a monster is to be esteemed one or many,
according to its principle, which he conceived the heart, whence he
derived the original of Nerves, and thereto ascribed many acts which
Physitians assign unto the brain: and therefore if it cannot be called
one, which hath a duplicity of hearts in his sense, it cannot receive
that appellation with a plurality of heads in ours. And this the
practice of Christians hath acknowledged, who have baptized these
geminous births, and double connascencies with several names, as
conceiving in them a distinction of souls, upon the divided execution of
their functions; that is, while one wept, the other laughing; while one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
was silent, the other speaking; while one awaked, the other sleeping; as
is declared by three remarkable examples in <i>Petrarch</i>, <i>Vincentius</i> and
the <i>Scottish</i> History of <i>Buchanan</i>.</p>

<p>It is not denied there have been bicipitous Serpents with the head at
each extream, for an example hereof we find in <i>Aristotle</i>, and of the
like form in <i>Aldrovandus</i> we meet with the Icon of a Lizzard; and of
this kind perhaps might that <i>Amphisb√¶na</i> be, the picture whereof
<i>Cassianus Puteus</i> shewed unto the learned <i>Faber</i>. Which double
formations do often happen unto multiparous generations, more especially
that of Serpents; whose productions being numerous, and their Eggs in
chains or links together (which sometime conjoin and inoculate into each
other) they may unite into various shapes and come out in mixed
formations. But these are monstrous productions, beside the intention of
Nature, and the statutes of generation, neither begotten of like
parents, nor begetting the like again, but irregularly produced, do
stand as Anomalies in the general Book of Nature. Which being shifts and
forced pieces, rather then genuine and proper effects, they afford us no
illation; nor is it reasonable to conclude, from a monstrosity unto a
species, or from accidental effects, unto the regular works of Nature.</p>

<p>Lastly, The ground of the conceit was the figure of this Animal, and
motion oft-times both ways; for described it is to be like a worm, and
so equally framed at both extreams, that at an ordinary distance it is
no easie matter to determine which is the head; and therefore some
observing them to move both ways, have given the appellation of heads
unto both extreams, which is no proper and warrantable denomination; for
many Animals with one head, do ordinarily perform<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span> both different and
contrary Motions; Crabs move sideling, Lobsters will swim swiftly
backward, Worms and Leeches will move both ways; and so will most of
those Animals, whose bodies consist of round and annulary fibers, and
move by undulation; that is, like the waves of the Sea, the one
protruding the other, by inversion whereof they make a backward Motion.</p>

<p>Upon the same ground hath arisen the same mistake concerning the
Scolopendra or hundred-footed Insect, as is delivered by <i>Rhodiginus</i>
from the Scholiast of <i>Nicander</i>: <i>Dicitur √† Nicandro</i>, ·ºÄŒºœÜŒπŒ∫Œ±œÅ·Ω¥œÇ, <i>id
est dicephalus aut biceps fictum vero, quoniam retrorsum</i> <a name="CORR1" id="CORR1"><ins class="correction" title="original: (ut scribit Aristoteles, arrepit">(<i>ut scribit
Aristoteles), arrepit</i></ins></a>, observed by <i>Aldrovandus</i>, but most plainly by
<i>Muffetus</i>, who thus concludeth upon the Text of <i>Nicander</i>: <i>Tamen pace
tanti authoris dixerim, unicum illi duntaxat caput licet pari
facilitate, prorsum capite, retrorsum ducente cauda, incedat, quod
Nicandro aliisque imposuisse dubito</i>: that is, under favour of so great
an Author, the Scopolendra hath but one head, although with equal
facility it moveth forward and backward, which I suspect deceived
<i>Nicander</i>, and others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p><p>And therefore we must crave leave to doubt of this double-headed Serpent
until we have the advantage to behold or have an iterated ocular
testimony concerning such as are sometimes mentioned by <i>American</i>
relators; and also such as <i>Cassianus Puteus</i> shewed in a picture to
<i>Johannes Faber</i>; and that which is set down under the name of
<i>Amphisb√¶na Europ√¶a</i> in his learned discourse upon <i>Hernandez</i> his
History of <i>America</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI_PE_III" id="CHAPTER_XVI_PE_III">CHAPTER XVI</a>
<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of the Viper.</span></h2>


<p>That the young Vipers force their way through the bowels of their Dam,
or that the female Viper in the act of generation bites off the head of
the male, in revenge whereof the young ones eat through the womb and
belly of the female, is a very ancient tradition. In this sense
entertained in the Hieroglyphicks of the <i>Egyptians</i>; affirmed by
<i>Herodotus</i>, <i>Nicander</i>, <i>Pliny</i>, <i>Plutarch</i>, <i>√Ülian</i>, <i>Jerome</i>,
<i>Basil</i>, <i>Isidore</i>, seems countenanced by <i>Aristotle</i>, and his Scholar
<i>Theophrastus</i>: from hence is commonly assigned the reason why the
<i>Romans</i> punished <i>Parricides</i> by drowning them in a Sack with a Viper.
And so perhaps upon the same opinion the men of <i>Melita</i> when they saw a
Viper upon the hand of <i>Paul</i>, said presently without conceit of any
other sin, <i>No doubt this man is a murderer, who though he have escaped
the Sea, yet vengeance suffereth him not to live</i>: that is, he is now
paid in his own way, the parricidous Animal and punishment of murderers
is upon him. And though the tradition were currant among the Greeks, to
confirm the same the Latine name is introduced, <i>Vipera quasi vi
pariat</i>; That passage also in the Gospel, <i>O ye generation of Vipers!</i>
hath found expositions which countenance this conceit. Notwithstanding
which authorities, transcribed relations and conjectures, upon enquiry
we find the same repugnant unto experience and reason.</p>

<p>And first, it seems not only injurious unto the providence of Nature, to
ordain a way of production which should destroy the producer, or
contrive the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span> continuation of the species by the destruction of the
Continuator; but it overthrows and frustrates the great Benediction of
God,<span class="sidenote10"> Gen. 1.</span> <i>God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful and multiply.</i>
Now if it be so ordained that some must regularly perish by
multiplication, and these be the fruits of fructifying in the Viper; it
cannot be said that God did bless, but curse this Animal: <i>Upon thy
belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all thy life</i>, was not so
great a punishment unto the Serpent after the fall, as <i>encrease, be
fruitful and multiply</i>, was before. This were to confound the
Maledictions of God, and translate the curse of the Woman upon the
Serpent: that is, <i>in dolore paries</i>, <i>in sorrow shalt thou bring
forth</i>; which being proper unto the Woman, is verified best in the
Viper, whose delivery is not only accompanied with pain, but also with
death it self. And lastly, it overthrows the careful course, and
parental provision of Nature, whereby the young ones newly excluded are
sustained by the Dam, and protected until they grow up to a sufficiency
for themselves. All which is perverted in this eruptive generation: for
the Dam being destroyed, the younglings are left to their own
protection: which is not conceivable they can at all perform, and
whereof they afford us a remarkable continuance many days after birth.
For the young one supposed to break through the belly of the Dam, will
upon any fright for protection run into it; for then the old one
receives them in at her mouth, which way the fright being past, they
will return again, which is a peculiar way of refuge; and although it
seem strange, is avowed by frequent experience and undeniable testimony.</p>

<p>As for the experiment, although we have thrice attempted it, it hath not
well succeeded; for though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span> we fed them with Milk, Bran, Cheese, etc.,
the females always died before the young ones were mature for this
eruption; but rest sufficiently confirmed in the experiments of worthy
enquirers. Wherein to omit the ancient conviction of <i>Apollonius</i>, we
shall set down some few of Modern Writers. <span class="sidenote"><i>That Vipers exclude
their young ones by an ordinary passage, as other viviparous
creatures.</i></span> The first, of <i>Amatus Lusitanus</i> in his Comment upon
<i>Dioscorides</i>, <i>Vidimus nos viperas pr√¶gnantes inclusas pixidibus
parere, qu√¶ inde ex partu nec mortu√¶, nec visceribus perforat√¶
manserunt.</i> The second is that of <i>Scaliger</i>, <i>Viperas ab impatientibus
mor√¶ f≈ìtibus numerosissimis rumpi atque interire falsum esse scimus,
qui in Vincentii Camerini circulatoris lignea theca vidimus, enatas
viperellas, parente salva.</i> The last and most plain of <i>Franciscus
Bustamantinus</i>, a <i>Spanish</i> Physitian of <i>Alcala de Henares</i>, whose
words in his third <i>de Animantibus Scriptur√¶</i>, are these: <i>Cum vero per
me et per alios h√¶c ipsa disquisissem servata Viperina progenie, etc.</i>:
that is, when by my self and others I had enquired the truth hereof,
including Vipers in a glass, and feeding them with Cheese and Bran, I
undoubtedly found that the Viper was not delivered by the tearing of her
bowels; but I beheld the young ones excluded by the passage of
generation, near the orifice of the seidge. Whereto we might also add
the ocular confirmation of <i>Lacuna</i> upon <i>Dioscorides</i>, <i>Ferdinandus
Imperatus</i>, and that learned Physician of <i>Naples</i>, <i>Aurelius
Severinus</i>.</p>

<p>Now although the Tradition be untrue, there wanted not many grounds
which made it plausibly received. The first was a favourable indulgence
and special contrivance of Nature; which was the conceit of <i>Herodotus</i>,
who thus delivereth himself. Fearful Animals, and such as serve for
food, Nature hath made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span> more fruitful; but upon the offensive and
noxious kind, she hath not conferred fertility. So the Hare that
becometh a prey unto Man, unto Beasts, and Fowls of the air, is fruitful
even to superf√¶tation; but the Lion, a fierce and ferocious Animal hath
young ones but seldom, and also but one at a time; Vipers indeed
although destructive are fruitful; but lest their number should
increase, Providence hath contrived another way to abate it: for in
copulation the female bites off the head of the male, and the young ones
destroy the mother. But this will not consist with reason, as we have
declared before. And if we more nearly consider the condition of Vipers
and noxious Animals we shall discover an higher provision of Nature: how
although in their paucity she hath not abridged their malignity, yet
hath she notoriously effected it by their secession or latitancy. For
not only offensive insects, as Hornets, Wasps, and the like; but
sanguineous corticated Animals, as Serpents, Toads and Lizzards, do lie
hid and betake themselves to coverts in the Winter. Whereby most
Countries enjoying the immunity of <i>Ireland</i> and <i>Candie</i>, there ariseth
a temporal security from their venoms; and an intermission of their
mischiefs, mercifully requiting the time of their activities.</p>

<p>A second ground of this effect, was conceived the justice of Nature,
whereby she compensates the death of the father by the matricide or
murder of the mother: and this was the expression of <i>Nicander</i>. But the
cause hereof is as improbable as the effect; and were indeed an
improvident revenge in the young ones, whereby in consequence, and upon
defect of provision they must destroy themselves. And whereas he
expresseth this decollation of the male by so full a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span> term as
·ºÄœÄŒøŒ∫œåœÄœÑŒµŒπŒΩ, that is, to cut or lop off, the act is hardly conceiveable;
for the Viper hath but two considerable teeth, and those so disposed, so
slender and needle-pointed, that they are apter for puncture then any
act of incision. And if any like action there be, it may be only some
fast retention or sudden compression in the <i>Orgasmus</i> or fury of their
lust; according as that expression of <i>Horace</i> is construed concerning
<i>Lydia</i> and <i>Telephus</i>.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="line indent8">&mdash;&mdash;<i>Sive puer furens,</i></div>
<div class="line"><i>Impressit memorem dente labris notam.</i></div>
</div></div>

<p>Others ascribe this effect unto the numerous conception of the Viper;
and this was the opinion of <i>Theophrastus</i>. Who though he denieth the
exesion or forcing through the belly, conceiveth nevertheless that upon
a full and plentiful impletion there may perhaps succeed a disruption of
the matrix, as it happeneth sometimes in the long and slender fish
<i>Acus</i>. <span class="sidenote"><i>Needle-fish, found sometimes upon the Sea-shore,
consisting of four lines unto the vent, and six from thence unto the
head.</i></span> Now although in hot Countries, and very numerous conceptions, in
the Viper or other Animals, there may sometimes ensue a dilaceration of
the genital parts; yet is this a rare and contingent effect, and not a
natural and constant way of exclusion. For the wise Creator hath formed
the organs of Animals unto their operations, and in whom he ordaineth a
numerous conception, in them he hath prepared convenient receptacles,
and a sutable way of exclusion.</p>

<p>Others do ground this disruption upon their continued or protracted time
of delivery, presumed to last twenty days; whereat excluding but one a
day, the latter brood impatient, by a forcible proruption anticipate
their period of exclusion; and this was the assertion of <i>Pliny</i>,
<i>C√¶teri tarditatis impatientes prorumpunt latera,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span> occis√¢ parente</i>;
which was occasioned upon a mistake of the Greek Text in <i>Aristotle</i>,
œÑŒØŒ∫œÑŒµŒπ Œ¥·Ω≤ ·ºêŒΩ ŒºŒØŒ± ·º†ŒºŒ≠œÅŒ± Œ∫Œ±Œ∏ º ·ºêŒΩ, œÑŒØŒ∫œÑŒµŒπ Œ¥·Ω≤ œÄŒªŒµŒØœâ ·º¢Œµ Œµ·º¥Œ∫ŒøœÉŒπŒΩ, which are
literally thus translated, <i>Parit autem una die secundum unum, parit
autem plures quam viginti</i>, and may be thus Englished, <i>She bringeth
forth in one day, one by one, and sometimes more than twenty</i>: and so
hath <i>Scaliger</i> rendered it, <i>Sigillatim parit absolvit, una die,
interdum plures quam viginti</i>: But <i>Pliny</i>, whom <i>Gaza</i> followeth, hath
differently translated it, <i>Singulos diebus singulis parit, numero fer√®
viginti</i>; whereby he extends the exclusion unto twenty days, which in
the textuary sense is fully accomplished in one.</p>

<p>But what hath most advanced it, is a mistake in another text of
<i>Aristotle</i>, which seemeth directly to determine this disruption, œÑŒØŒ∫œÑŒµŒπ
ŒºŒπŒ∫œÅ·Ω∞ ·ºêœáŒØŒ¥ŒπŒ± ·ºêŒΩ ·ΩëŒºŒ≠œÉŒπŒΩ, ·ºÅŒπ œÄŒµœÅŒπœÅœÅŒÆŒ≥ŒΩœÖŒΩœÑŒ±Œπ œÑœÅŒπœÑŒ±·øñŒøŒπ, ·ºêŒΩŒØŒøœÑŒµ Œ¥·Ω≤ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ ·ºîœÉœâŒ∏ŒµŒΩ
Œ¥ŒπŒ±œÜŒ±Œ≥œåŒΩœÑŒ± Œ±·ΩêœÑ·Ω∞ ·ºêŒæŒ≠œÅœáŒµœÑŒ±Œπ, which <i>Gaza</i> hath thus translated, <i>Purit
catulos abvolutos membranis qu√¶ tertio die rumpuntur, evenit interdum ut
qui in utero adhuc sunt abrosis membranis prorumpant.</i> Now herein
probably <i>Pliny</i>, and many since have been mistaken; for the disruption
of the membranes or skins, which include the young ones, conceiving a
dilaceration of the matrix and belly of the Viper: and concluding from a
casual dilaceration, a regular and constant disruption.</p>

<p>As for the Latine word <i>Vipera</i>, which in the Etymologie of <i>Isidore</i>
promoteth this conceit; more properly it may imply <i>vivipera</i>. For
whereas other Serpents lay Eggs, the Viper excludeth living Animals; and
though the <i>Cerastes</i> be also viviparous, and we have found formed
Snakes in the belly of the <i>Cicilia</i> or Slow-worm; yet may the Viper
emphatically bear the name. For the notation or Etymology is not of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
necessity adequate unto the name; and therefore though animal be deduced
from <i>anima</i>, yet are there many animations beside, and Plants will
challenge a right therein as well as sensible Creatures.</p>

<p>As touching the Text of Scripture, and compellation of the <i>Pharisees</i>,
by Generation of Vipers, although constructions be made hereof
conformable to this Tradition; and it may be plausibly expounded, that
out of a viperous condition, they conspired against their Prophets, and
destroyed their spiritual parents; yet (as <i>Jansenius</i> observeth)
<i>Gregory</i> and <i>Jerome</i>, do make another construction; apprehending
thereby what is usually implied by that Proverb, <i>Mali corvi, malum
ovum</i>; that is, of evil parents, an evil generation, a posterity not
unlike their majority; of mischievous progenitors, a venomous and
destructive progeny.</p>

<p>And lastly, Concerning the Hieroglyphical account, according to the
Vulgar conception set down by <i>Orus Apollo</i>, the Authority thereof is
only Emblematical; for were the conception true or false, to their
apprehensions, it expressed filial impiety. Which strictly taken, and
totally received for truth, might perhaps begin, but surely promote this
conception.</p>

<p>More doubtful assertions have been raised of no Animal then the Viper,
as we have dispersedly noted: and <i>Francisco Redi</i> hath amply discovered
in his noble observations of Vipers; from good reasons and iterated
experiments affirming, that a Viper containeth no humour, excrement, or
part which either dranke or eat, is able to kill any: that the
<i>remorsores</i> or dog-teeth, are not more than two in either sex: that
these teeth are hollow, and though they bite and prick therewith, yet
are they not venomous, but only open a way and entrance unto the poyson,
which notwith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>standing is not poysonous except it touch or attain unto
the bloud. And that there is no other poison in this Animal, but only
that almost insipid liquor like oyl of Almonds, which stagnates in the
sheaths and cases that cover the teeth; and that this proceeds not from
the bladder of gall, but is rather generated in the head, and perhaps
demitted and sent from thence into these cases by salival conducts and
passages, which the head communicateth unto them.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII_PE_III" id="CHAPTER_XVII_PE_III">CHAPTER XVII</a>
<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of Hares.</span></h2>


<p>The double sex of single Hares, or that every Hare is both male and
female, beside the vulgar opinion, was the affirmative of <i>Archelaus</i>,
of <i>Plutarch</i>, <i>Philostratus</i>, and many more. Of the same belief have
been the Jewish <i>Rabbins</i>; The same is likewise confirmed from the
Hebrew word;<span class="sidenote10">Arnabeth.</span> which, as though there were no single males
of that kind, hath only obtained a name of the feminine gender. As also
from the symbolical foundation of its prohibition in the law,
<span class="sidenote10"><i>Levit.</i> 11.</span> and what vices therein are figured; that is, not only
pusillanimity and timidity from its temper, feneration or usury from its
f≈ìcundity and superfetation; but from this mixture of sexes,
unnatural venery and degenerous effemination. Nor are there hardly any
who either treat of mutation or mixtion of sexes, who have not left some
mention of this point; some speaking positively, others dubiously, and
most resigning it unto the enquiry of the Reader. Now hereof to speak
distinctly, they must be male and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span> female by mutation and succession of
sexes; or else by composition, mixture or union thereof.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Transmutation of Sexes</i>, viz. <i>of Women into Men, granted</i>.</div>

<p>As for the mutation of sexes, or transition into one another, we cannot
deny it in Hares, it being observable in Man. For hereof beside
<i>Empedocles</i> or <i>Tiresias</i>, there are not a few examples: and though
very few, or rather none which have emasculated or turned women, yet
very many who from an esteem or reality of being Women have infallibly
proved Men. Some at the first point of their menstruous eruptions, some
in the day of their marriage, others many years after: which occasioned
disputes at Law, and contestations concerning a restore of the dowry.
And that not only mankind, but many other Animals may suffer this
transexion, we will not deny, or hold it at all impossible: although I
confess by reason of the postick and backward position of the feminine
parts in quadrupedes, they can hardly admit the substitution of a
protrusion, effectual unto masculine generation; except it be in
Retromingents, and such as couple backward.</p>

<p>Nor shall we only concede the succession of sexes in some, but shall not
dispute the transition of reputed species in others; that is, a
transmutation, or (as <i>Paracelsians</i> term it) Transplantation of one
into another. Hereof in perfect Animals of a congenerous seed, or near
affinity of natures, examples are not unfrequent, as in Horses, Asses,
Dogs, Foxes, Pheasants, Cocks, etc. but in imperfect kinds, and such
where the discrimination of sexes is obscure, these transformations are
more common; and in some within themselves without commixtion, as
particularly in Caterpillars or Silkworms, wherein there is a visible
and triple transfiguration. But in Plants, wherein there is no
distinction of sex, these transplantations are conceived more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span> obvious
then any; as that of Barley into Oats, of Wheat into Darnel; and those
grains which generally arise among Corn, as Cockle, Aracus, √Ügilops, and
other degenerations; which come up in unexpected shapes, when they want
the support and maintenance of the primary and master-forms. And the
same do some affirm concerning other Plants in less analogy of figures;
as the mutation of Mint into Cresses, Basil into Serpoile, and Turneps
into Radishes. In all which, as <i>Severinus</i> conceiveth,<span class="sidenote">In Idea
Medicin√¶ Philosophic√¶.</span> there may be equivocal seeds and
Hermaphroditical principles, which contain the radicality and power of
different forms; thus in the seed of Wheat there lieth obscurely the
seminality of Darnel, although in a secondary or inferiour way, and at
some distance of production; which nevertheless if it meet with
convenient promotion, or a conflux and conspiration of causes more
powerful then the other, it then beginneth to edifie in chief, and
contemning the superintendent form, produceth the signatures of its
self.</p>

<p>Now therefore although we deny not these several mutations, and do allow
that Hares may exchange their sex, yet this we conceive doth come to
pass but sometimes, and not in that vicissitude or annual alteration as
is presumed. That is, from imperfection to perfection, from perfection
to imperfection; from female unto male, from male to female again, and
so in a circle to both without a permansion in either. For beside the
inconceivable mutation of temper, which should yearly alternate the sex,
this is injurious unto the order of nature, whose operations do rest in
the perfection of their intents; which having once attained, they
maintain their accomplished ends, and relapse not again into their
progressional imperfections. So if in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span> the minority of natural vigor,
the parts of seminality take place; when upon the encrease or growth
thereof the masculine appear, the first design of nature is atchieved,
and those parts are after maintained.</p>

<p>But surely it much impeacheth this iterated transexion of Hares, if that
be true which <i>Cardan</i> and other Physicians affirm, that Transmutation
of sex is only so in opinion; and that these transfeminated persons were
really men at first; although succeeding years produced the manifesto or
evidence of their virilities. Which although intended and formed, was
not at first excluded: and that the examples hereof have undergone no
real or new transexion, but were Androgynally born, and under some kind
of <i>Hermaphrodites</i>. For though <i>Galen</i> do favour the opinion, that the
distinctive parts of sexes are only different in Position, that is,
inversion or protrusion; yet will this hardly be made out from the
Anatomy of those parts. The testicles being so seated in the female,
that they admit not of protrusion; and the neck of the matrix wanting
those parts which are discoverable in the organ of virility.</p>

<p>The second and most received acception, is, that Hares are male and
female by conjunction of both sexes; and such as are found in mankind,
Poetically called Hermaphrodites; supposed to be formed from the
equality, or <i>non victorie</i> of either seed; carrying about them the
parts of Man and Woman; although with great variety in perfection, site
and ability; not only as <i>Aristotle</i> conceived, with a constant
impotency in one; but as later observers affirm, sometimes with ability
of either venery. And therefore the providence of some Laws have thought
good, that at the years of maturity they should elect one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span> sex, and the
errors in the other should suffer a severer punishment. Whereby
endeavouring to prevent incontinency, they unawares enjoyned perpetual
chastity; for being executive in both parts, and confined unto one, they
restrained a natural power, and ordained a partial virginity. <i>Plato</i>
and some of the Rabbins proceeded higher; who conceived the first Man an
Hermaphrodite; and <i>Marcus Leo</i> the learned <i>Jew</i>, in some sense hath
allowed it; affirming that <i>Adam</i> in one suppositum without division,
contained both Male and Female. And therefore whereas it is said in the
text, That God created man in his own Image, in the Image of God created
he him, male and female created he them: applying the singular and
plural unto <i>Adam</i>, it might denote, that in one substance, and in
himself he included both sexes, which was after divided, and the female
called Woman. The opinion of <i>Aristotle</i> extendeth farther, from whose
assertion all men should be Hermaphrodites; for affirming that Women do
not spermatize, and confer a place or receptacle rather then essential
principles of generation, he deductively includes both sexes in mankind;
for from the father proceed not only males and females, but from him
also must Hermaphroditical and masculo-feminine generations be derived,
and a commixtion of both sexes arise from the seed of one. But the
Schoolmen have dealt with that sex more hardly then any other; who
though they have not much disputed their generation, yet have they
controverted their Resurrection, and raisen a querie, whether any at the
last day should arise in the sex of Women; as may be observed in the
supplement of <i>Aquinas</i>.</p>

<p>Now as we must acknowledge this Androgynal condition in Man,
<span class="sidenote"><i>Consisting of man and woman.</i></span> so can we not deny the like doth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
happen in beasts. Thus do we read in <i>Pliny</i>, that <i>Neroes</i> Chariot was
drawn by four Hermaphroditical Mares, and <i>Cardan</i> affirms he also
beheld one at <i>Antwerp</i>. And thus may we also concede, that Hares have
been of both sexes, and some have ocularly confirmed it; but that the
whole species or kind should be bisexous or double-sexed, we cannot
affirm, who have found the parts of male and female respectively
distinct and single in any wherein we have enquired: And the like
success had <i>Bacchinus</i><span class="sidenote">Bacch. De Hermaphroditis.</span> in such as he
dissected. And whereas it is conceived, that being an harmless Animal
and delectable food unto man, nature hath made them with double sexes,
that actively and passively performing they might more numerously
increase; we forget an higher providence of nature whereby she
especially promotes the multiplication of Hares, which is by
superfetation; that is, a conception upon a conception, or an
improvement of a second fruit before the first be excluded; preventing
hereby the usual intermission and vacant time of generation; which is
very common and frequently observable in Hares, mentioned long ago by
<i>Aristotle</i>, <i>Herodotus</i>, and <i>Pliny</i>; and we have often observed, that
after the first cast, there remain successive conceptions, and other
younglings very immature, and far from their term of exclusion.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Superfetation possible in women, and that unto a perfect
birth.</i></div>

<p>Nor need any man to question this in Hares, for the same we observe doth
sometime happen in Women; for although it be true, that upon conception
the inward orifice of the matrix exactly closeth, so that it commonly
admitteth nothing after; yet falleth it out sometime, that in the act of
coition, the avidity of that part dilateth it self, and receiveth a
second burden; which if it happen to be near in time unto the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span> first,
they do commonly both proceed unto perfection, and have legitimate
exclusions, periodically succeeding each other. But if the superfetation
be made with considerable intermission, the latter most commonly proves
abortive; for the first being confirmed, engrosseth the aliment from the
other. However therefore the project of <i>Julia</i> seem very plausible, and
that way infallible, when she received not her passengers, before she
had taken in her lading, yet was there a fallibility therein: nor indeed
any absolute security in the policy of adultery after conception. For
the Matrix (which some have called another Animal within us, and which
is not subjected unto the law of our will) after reception of its proper
Tenant, may yet receive a strange and spurious inmate. As is confirmable
by many examples in <i>Pliny</i>; by <i>Lariss√¶a</i> in <i>Hippocrates</i> and that
merry one in <i>Plautus</i> urged also by <i>Aristotle</i>: that is, of <i>Iphicles</i>
and <i>Hercules</i>, the one begat by <i>Jupiter</i>, the other by <i>Amphitryon</i>
upon <i>Alem√¶na</i> as also in those super-conceptions, where one child was
like the father, the other like the adulterer, the one favoured the
servant, the other resembled the master.</p>

<p>Now the grounds that begat, or much promoted the opinion of a double sex
in Hares, might be some little bags or tumours, at first glance
representing stones or Testicles, to be found in both sexes about the
parts of generation; which men observing in either sex, were induced to
believe a masculine sex in both. But to speak properly, these are no
Testicles or parts official unto generation, but glandulous substances
that seem to hold the nature of Emunctories. For herein may be perceived
slender perforations, at which may be expressed a black and f√¶culent
matter. If therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span> from these we shall conceive a mixtion of sexes in
Hares, with fairer reason we may conclude it in Bevers; whereof both
sexes contain a double bag or Tumour in the groin, commonly called the
Cod of <i>Castor</i>, as we have delivered before.</p>

<p>Another ground were certain holes or cavities observable about the
siedge; which being perceived in Males, made some conceive there might
be also a f≈ìminine nature in them. And upon this very ground, the
same opinion hath passed upon the Hy√¶na, and is declared by <i>Aristotle</i>,
and thus translated by <i>Scaliger</i>; <i>Quod autem aiunt utriusque sexus
habere genitalia, falsum est, quod videtur esse f≈ìmineum sub cauda
est simile figura f≈ìminino, verum pervium non est</i>; and thus is it
also in Hares, in whom these holes, although they seem to make a deep
cavity, yet do they not perforate the skin, nor hold a community with
any part of generation: but were (as <i>Pliny</i> delivereth) esteemed the
marks of their age, the number of those deciding their number of years.
In which opinion what truth there is we shall not contend; for if in
other Animals there be authentick notations, if the characters of years
be found in the horns of Cows, or in the Antlers of Deer; if we
conjecture the age of Horses from joints in their docks, and undeniably
presume it from their teeth; we cannot affirm, there is in this conceit,
any affront unto nature; although who ever enquireth shall find no
assurance therein.</p>

<p>The last foundation was Retromingency or pissing backward; for men
observing both sexes to urine backward, or aversly between their legs,
they might conceive there was a f≈ìminine part in both; wherein they
are deceived by the ignorance of the just and proper site of the Pizzel,
or part designed unto the Excretion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span> of urine; which in the Hare holds
not the common position, but is aversly seated, and in its distention
enclines unto the Coccix or Scut. Now from the nature of this position,
there ensueth a necessity of Retrocopulation, which also promoteth the
conceit: for some observing them to couple without ascension, have not
been able to judge of male or female, or to determine the proper sex in
either. And to speak generally, this way of copulation is not
appropriate unto Hares, nor is there one, but many ways of coition:
according to divers shapes and different conformations. For some couple
laterally or sidewise, as Worms: some circularly or by complication, as
Serpents: some pronely, that is, by contaction of the ventral parts in
both, as Apes, Porcupines, Hedgehogs, and such as are termed Mollia, as
the Cuttle-fish and the Purple; some mixtly, that is, the male ascending
the female, or by application of the ventral parts of the one, unto the
postick parts of the other, as most Quadrupeds: Some aversly, as all
Crustaceous Animals, Lobsters, Shrimps, and Crevises, and also
Retromingents, as Panthers, Tygers, and Hares. This is the constant Law
of their Coition, this they observe and transgress not: onely the
vitiosity of man hath acted the varieties hereof; nor content with a
digression from sex or species, hath in his own kind run thorow the
Anomalies of venery; and been so bold, not only to act, but represent to
view, the irregular ways of Lust.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII_PE_III" id="CHAPTER_XVIII_PE_III">CHAPTER XVIII</a>
<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of Moles, or Molls.</span></h2>


<p>That Moles are blind and have no eyes, though a common opinion, is
received with much variety; some affirming only they have no sight, as
<i>Oppianus</i>, the Proverb <i>Talpa C√¶cior</i>, and the word œÉœÄŒ±ŒªŒ±œáŒØŒ±, or
<i>Talpitas</i>, which in <i>Hesychius</i> is made the same with <i>C√¶citas</i>: some
that they have eyes, but no sight, as the text of <i>Aristotle</i> seems to
imply; some neither eyes nor sight, as <i>Albertus</i>, <i>Pliny</i>, and the
vulgar opinion; some both eyes and sight, as <i>Scaliger</i>, <i>Aldrovandus</i>,
and some others. Of which opinions the last with some restriction, is
most consonant unto truth: for that they have eyes in their head is
manifest unto any, that wants them not in his own: and are discoverable,
not only in old ones, but as we have observed in young and naked
conceptions, taken out of the belly of the Dam. And he that exactly
enquires into the cavity of their cranies, may perhaps discover some
propagation of nerves communicated unto these parts. But that the
humours together with their coats are also distinct (though <i>Galen</i> seem
to affirm it) transcendeth our discovery; for separating these little
Orbs, and including them in magnifying Glasses, we discerned no more
then <i>Aristotle</i> mentions, œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ ·ΩÄœÜŒ∏Œ±ŒªŒº·ø∂ŒΩ ŒºŒ≠ŒªŒ±ŒπŒΩŒ±, that is, a black
humour, nor any more if they be broken. That therefore they have eyes we
must of necessity affirm; but that they be comparatively incomplete we
need not to deny: So <i>Galen</i> affirms the parts of generation in women
are imperfect, in respect of those of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span> men, as the eyes of Moles in
regard of other Animals; So <i>Aristotle</i> terms them œÄŒ∑œÅŒøœÖŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒøœÖœÇ, which
<i>Gaza</i> translates <i>Obl√¶sos</i>, and <i>Scaliger</i> by a word of imperfection
<i>inchoatos</i>.</p>

<p>Now as that they have eyes is manifest unto sense, so that they have
sight not incongruous unto reason; if we call not in question the
providence of this provision, that is, to assign the Organs, and yet
deny the Office, to grant them eyes and withhold all manner of vision.
For as the inference is fair, affirmatively deduced from the action to
the Organ, that they have eyes because they see; so is it also from the
organ to the action, that they have eyes, therefore some sight designed,
if we take the intention of Nature in every species, and except the
casual impediments, or morbosities in individuals. But as their eyes are
more imperfect then others, so do we conceive of their sight or act of
vision, for they will run against things, and hudling forwards fall from
high places. So that they are not blind, nor yet distinctly see; there
is in them no Cecity, yet more then a Cecutiency; they have sight enough
to discern the light, though not perhaps to distinguish of objects or
colours; so are they not exactly blind, for light is one object of
vision. And this (as <i>Scaliger</i> observeth) might be as full a sight as
Nature first intended, for living in darkness under the earth, they had
no further need of eyes then to avoid the light; and to be sensible when
ever they lost that darkness of earth, which was their natural
confinement. And therefore however Translators do render the word of
<i>Aristotle</i> or <i>Galen</i>, that is, <i>imperfectos obl√¶sos</i> or <i>inchoatos</i>,
it is not much considerable; for their eyes are sufficiently begun to
finish this action, and competently perfect for this imperfect Vision.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>And lastly, although they had neither eyes nor sight, yet could they not
be termed blind. For blindness being a privative term unto sight, this
appellation is not admittible in propriety of speech, and will overthrow
the doctrine of privations; which presuppose positive forms or habits,
and are not indefinite negations, denying in all subjects, but such
alone wherein the positive habits are in their proper Nature, and placed
without repugnancy. So do we improperly say a Mole is blind, if we deny
it the Organs or a capacity of vision from its created Nature; so when
the text of <i>John</i> had said, that person was blind from his nativity,
whose cecity our Saviour cured, it was not warrantable in <i>Nonnus</i> to
say he had no eyes at all, as in the judgment of <i>Heinsius</i>, he
describeth in his paraphrase; and as some ancient Fathers affirm, that
by this miracle they were created in him. And so though the sense may be
accepted, that Proverb must be candidly interpreted, which maketh fishes
Mute; and calls them silent which have no voice in Nature.</p>

<p>Now this conceit is erected upon a misapprehension or mistake in the
symtomes of vision; men confounding abolishment, diminution and
depravement, and naming that an abolition of sight, which indeed is but
an abatement. For if vision be abolished, it is called <i>c√¶citas</i>, or
blindness; if depraved and receive its objects erroneously,
Hallucination; if diminished, <i>hebetudo visus</i>, <i>caligatio</i>, or dimness.
Now instead of a diminution or imperfect vision in the Mole, we affirm
an abolition or total privation; instead of a caligation or dimness, we
conclude a cecity or blindness. Which hath been frequently inferred
concerning other Animals; so some affirm the Water-Rat is blind, so
<i>Sammonicus</i> and <i>Nicander</i> do call the Mus-Araneus the shrew or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span> Ranny,
blind: And because darkness was before light, the <i>√Ügyptians</i> worshipped
the same. So are <i>C√¶cili√¶</i> or Slow-worms accounted blind, and the like
we affirm proverbially of the Beetle; although their eyes be evident,
and they will flye against lights, like many other Insects, and though
also <i>Aristotle</i> determines, that the eyes are apparent in all flying
Insects, though other senses be obscure, and not perceptible at all. And
if from a diminution we may infer a total privation, or affirm that
other Animals are blind which do not acutely see, or comparatively unto
others, we shall condemn unto blindness many not so esteemed; for such
as have corneous or horney eyes, as Lobsters and crustaceous Animals,
are generally dim-sighted; all Insects that have <i>antenn√¶</i>, or long
horns to feel out their way, as Butterflyes and Locusts; or their
forelegs so disposed, that they much advance before their heads, as may
be observed in Spiders; and if the Eagle were judge, we might be blind
our selves. The expression therefore of Scripture in the story of
<i>Jacob</i> is surely with circumspection: And it came to pass when <i>Jacob</i>
was old, and his eyes were dim, <i>quando caligarunt oculi</i>, saith
<i>Jerome</i> and <i>Tremellius</i>, which are expressions of diminution, and not
of absolute privation.</p>

<p>Other concerns there are of Molls, which though not commonly opinioned
are not commonly enough considered: As the peculiar formation of their
feet, the slender <i>ossa Iugalia</i>, and Dogteeth, and how hard it is to
keep them alive out of the Earth: As also the ferity and voracity of
these animals; for though they be contented with Roots, and stringy
parts of Plants, or Wormes under ground, yet when they are above it will
sometimes tear and eat one another, and in a large glass wherein a Moll,
a Toad, and a Viper were in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>closed, we have known the Moll to dispatch
them and to devour a good part of them both.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX_PE_III" id="CHAPTER_XIX_PE_III">CHAPTER XIX</a>
<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of Lampries.</span></h2>


<p>Whether Lampries have nine eyes, as is received, we durst refer it unto
<i>Polyphemus</i>, who had but one, to judge it. An error concerning eyes,
occasioned by the error of eyes; deduced from the appearance of diverse
cavities or holes on either side, which some call eyes that carelessly
behold them; and is not only refutable by experience, but also repugnant
unto Reason. For beside the monstrosity they fasten unto Nature, in
contriving many eyes, who hath made but two unto any Animal, that is,
one of each side, according to the division of the brain; it were a
superfluous inartificial act to place and settle so many in one plane;
for the two extreams would sufficiently perform the office of sight
without the help of the intermediate eyes, and behold as much as all
seven joyned together. For the visible base of the object would be
defined by these two; and the middle eyes, although they behold the same
thing, yet could they not behold so much thereof as these; so were it no
advantage unto man to have a third eye between those two he hath
already; and the fiction of <i>Argus</i> seems more reasonable then this; for
though he had many eyes, yet were they placed in circumference and
positions of advantage, and so are they placed in several lines in
Spiders.</p>

<p>Again, These cavities which men call eyes are seated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span> out of the head,
and where the Gils of other fish are placed; containing no Organs of
sight, nor having any Communication with the brain. <span class="sidenote"><i>All
sense is from the brain.</i></span> Now all sense proceeding from the brain, and
that being placed (as <i>Galen</i> observeth) in the upper part of the body,
for the fitter situation of the eyes, and conveniency required unto
sight; it is not reasonable to imagine that they are any where else, or
deserve that name which are seated in other parts. And therefore we
relinquish as fabulous what is delivered of <i>Sternopthalmi</i>, or men with
eyes in their breast, and when it is said by <i>Solomon</i>, A wise mans eyes
are in his head, it is to be taken in a second sense, and affordeth no
objection. True it is that the eyes of Animals are seated with some
difference, but in sanguineous animals in the head, and that more
forward then the ear or hole of hearing. In quadrupedes, in regard of
the figure of their heads, they are placed at some distance; in
latirostrous and flat-bill&rsquo;d birds they are more laterally seated, and
therefore when they look intently they turn one eye upon the object, and
can convert their heads to see before and behind, and to behold two
opposite points at once. But at a more easie distance are they situated
in man, and in the same circumference with the ear; for if one foot of
the compass be placed upon the Crown, a circle described thereby will
intersect, or pass over both the ears.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>To what use the nine eyes in a Lamprie do serve.</i></div>

<p>The error in this conceit consists in the ignorance of these cavities,
and their proper use in nature; for this is a particular disposure of
parts, and a peculiar conformation whereby these holes and sluces supply
the defect of Gils, and are assisted by the conduit in the head; for
like cetaceous Animals and Whales, the Lamprie hath a fistula, spout or
pipe at the back part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span> of the head, whereat it spurts out water. Nor is
it only singular in this formation, but also in many other; as in defect
of bones, whereof it hath not one; and for the spine or backbone, a
cartilaginous substance without any spondyles, processes or protuberance
whatsoever. As also in the provision which Nature hath made for the
heart; which in this Animal is very strangely secured, and lies immured
in a cartilage or gristly substance. And lastly, in the colour of the
liver: which is in the Male of an excellent grass-green: but of a deeper
colour in the Female, and will communicate a fresh and durable verdure.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX_PE_III" id="CHAPTER_XX_PE_III">CHAPTER XX</a>
<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of Snayls.</span></h2>


<p>Whether <i>Snayls</i> have eyes some Learned men have doubted. For <i>Scaliger</i>
terms them but imitations of eyes; and <i>Aristotle</i> upon consequence
denyeth them, when he affirms that <i>Testaceous</i> Animals have no eyes.
But this now seems sufficiently asserted by the help of exquisite
Glasses, which discover those black and atramentous spots or globales to
be their eyes.</p>

<p>That they have two eyes is the common opinion, but if they have two
eyes, we may grant them to have no less than four, that is, two in the
larger extensions above, and two in the shorter and lesser horns below,
and this number may be allowed in these inferiour and exanguious
animals; since we may observe the articulate and latticed eyes in Flies,
and nine in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span> Spiders: And in the great <i>Phalangium</i> Spider of
<i>America</i>, we plainly number eight.</p>

<p>But in sanguineous animals, quadrupeds, bipeds, or man, no such number
can be regularly verified, or multiplicity of eyes confirmed. And
therefore what hath been under this kind delivered, concerning the
plurality, paucity or anomalous situation of eyes, is either monstrous,
fabulous, or under things never seen includes good sense or meaning. And
so may we receive the figment of <i>Argus</i>, who was an Hieroglyphick of
heaven, in those centuries of eyes expressing the stars; and their
alternate wakings, the vicissitude of day and night. Which strictly
taken cannot be admitted; for the subject of sleep is not the eye, but
the common sense, which once asleep, all eyes must be at rest. And
therefore what is delivered as an Embleme of vigilancy, that the Hare
and Lion do sleep with one eye open, doth not evince they are any more
awake then if they were both closed. For the open eye beholds in sleep
no more then that which is closed; and no more one eye in them then two
in other Animals that sleep with both open; as some by disease, and
others naturally which have no eye-lids at all.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>How things happen to be seen as double.</i></div>

<p>As for Polyphemus, although the story be fabulous, the monstrosity is
not impossible. For the act of Vision may be performed with one eye; and
in the deception and fallacy of sight, hath this advantage of two, that
it beholds not objects double, or sees two things for one. For this doth
happen when the axis of the visive cones, diffused from the object, fall
not upon the same plane; but that which is conveyed into one eye, is
more depressed or elevated then that which enters the other. So if
beholding a Candle, we pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>trude either upward or downward the pupill of
one eye, the object will appear double; but if we shut the other eye,
and behold it with one, it will their appear but single; and if we
abduce the eye unto either corner, the object will not duplicate: for in
that position the axis of the cones remain in the same plane, as is
demonstrated in the opticks, and delivered by <i>Galen</i>, in his tenth <i>De
usu partium</i>.</p>

<p>Relations also there are of men that could make themselves invisible,
which belongs not to this discourse: but may serve as notable
expressions of wise and prudent men, who so contrive their affairs, that
although their actions be manifest, their designs are not discoverable.
In this acception there is nothing left of doubt, and <i>Giges</i> Ring
remaineth still amongst us: for vulgar eyes behold no more of wise men
then doth the Sun: they may discover their exteriour and outward ways,
but their interiour and inward pieces he only sees, that sees into their
beings.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI_PE_III" id="CHAPTER_XXI_PE_III">CHAPTER XXI</a>
<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of the Chameleon.</span></h2>


<p>Concerning the <i>Chameleon</i> there generally passeth an opinion that it
liveth only upon air, and is sustained by no other aliment: Thus much is
in plain terms affirmed by <i>Solinus</i>, <i>Pliny</i>, and others, and by this
periphrasis is the same described by <i>Ovid</i>. All which notwithstanding,
upon enquiry I find the assertion mainly controvertible, and very much
to fail in the three inducements of belief.</p>

<p>And first for its verity, although asserted by some,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span> and traditionally
delivered by others, yet is it very questionable. For beside <i>√Ülian</i>,
who is seldom defective in these accounts; <i>Aristotle</i> distinctly
treating hereof, hath made no mention of this remarkable propriety:
which either suspecting its verity, or presuming its falsity, he surely
omitted: for that he remained ignorant of this account it is not easily
conceiveable: it being the common opinion, and generally received by all
men. Some have positively denied it, as <i>Augustinus</i>, <i>Niphus</i>,
<i>Stob√¶us</i>, <i>Dalechampius</i>, <i>Fortunius Licetus</i>, with many more; others
have experimentally refuted it, as namely <i>Johannes Landius</i>, who in the
relation of <i>Scaliger</i>, observed a <i>Chameleon</i> to lick up a fly from his
breast: But <i>Bellonius</i> <span class="sidenote"><i>Comment. in Ocell.</i> Lucan.</span> hath
been more satisfactorily experimental, not only affirming they feed on
Flies, Caterpillars, Beetles and other Insects, but upon exenteration he
found these Animals in their bellies: whereto we might also add the
experimental decisions of the worthy <i>Peireschius</i> and learned <i>Emanuel
Vizzanius</i>, in that <i>Chameleon</i> which had been often observed to drink
water, and delight to feed on Meal-worms. And although we have not had
the advantage of our own observation, yet have we received the like
confirmation from many ocular spectators.</p>

<p>As touching the verisimility or probable truth of this relation, several
reasons there are which seem to overthrow it. For first, there are found
in this Animal, the guts, the stomack, and other parts official unto
nutrition; which were its aliment the empty reception of air, their
provisions had been superfluous. Now the wisdom of nature abhorring
superfluities, and effecting nothing in vain, unto the intention of
these operations, respectively contriveth the Organs; and therefore
where we find such Instruments, we may with strict<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>ness expect their
actions; and where we discover them not, we may with safety conclude the
non-intention of their operations. So when we perceive that Bats have
teats, it is not unreasonable to infer they suckle their younglings with
milk; but whereas no other flying Animal hath these parts, we cannot
from them expect a viviparous exclusion; but either a generation of
eggs, or some vermiparous separation, whose navel is within it self at
first, and its nutrition after not connexedly depending of its original.</p>

<p>Again, Nature is so far from leaving any one part without its proper
action, that she oft-times imposeth two or three labours upon one, so
the Pizel in Animals is both official unto Urine and to generation, but
the first and primary use is generation; for some creatures enjoy that
part which urine not. So the nostrils are useful both for respiration
and smelling, but the principal use is smelling; for many have nostrils
which have no lungs, as fishes, but none have lungs or respiration,
which have not some shew, or some analogy of nostrils. <span class="sidenote"><i>Nature
provides no part without its proper function or office.</i></span> Thus we
perceive the providence of Nature, that is, the wisdom of God, which
disposeth of no part in vain, and some parts unto two or three uses,
will not provide any without the execution of its proper office, nor
where there is no digestion to be made, make any parts inservient to
that intention.</p>

<p>Beside the remarkable teeth, the tongue of this animal is a second
argument to overthrow this airy nutrication: and that not only in its
proper nature, but also its peculiar figure. For of this part properly
taken there are two ends; that is, the formation of the voice, and the
execution of tast; for the voice, it can have no office in <i>Chameleons</i>,
for they are mute Animals; as beside fishes, are most other sorts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Lizards. As for their tast, if their nutriment be air, neither can it be
an Instrument thereof; for the body of that element is ingustible, void
of all sapidity, and without any action of the tongue, is by the rough
artery or wezon conducted into the lungs. And therefore <i>Pliny</i> much
forgets the strictness of his assertion, when he alloweth excrements
unto that Animal, that feedeth only upon Air; which notwithstanding with
the urine of an Ass, he commends as a magicall Medicine upon our
enemies.</p>

<p>The figure of the tongue seems also to overthrow the presumption of this
aliment, which according to exact delineation, is in this Animal
peculiar, and seemeth contrived for prey. For in so little a creature it
is at the least a palm long, and being it self very slow in motion, hath
in this part a very great agility; withall its food being flies and such
as suddenly escape, it hath in the tongue a mucous and slimy extremity,
whereby upon a sudden emission it inviscates and tangleth those Insects.
And therefore some have thought its name not unsuitable unto its nature;
the nomination in Greek is a little Lion;<span class="sidenote15">œáŒ±ŒπŒºŒ±ŒπŒªŒ≠œâŒΩ.</span> not so much
for the resemblance of shape, as affinity of condition; that is for
vigilancy in its prey, and sudden rapacity thereof, which it performeth
not like the Lion with its teeth, but a sudden and unexpected
ejaculation of the tongue. This exposition is favoured by some,
especially the old gloss upon <i>Leviticus</i>, whereby in the Translation of
<i>Jerome</i> and the Septuagint, this Animal is forbidden; what ever it be,
it seems as reasonable as that of <i>Isidore</i>, who derives this name <i>√†
Camelo et Leone</i>, as presuming herein resemblance with a Camell.</p>

<p>As for the possibility hereof, it is not also unquestionable; and wise
men are of opinion, the bodies of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span> Animals cannot receive a proper
aliment from air; for beside that tast being (as <i>Aristotle</i> terms it) a
kind of touch; it is required the aliment should be tangible, and fall
under the palpable affections of touch; beside also that there is some
sapor in all aliments, as being to be distinguished and judged by the
gust; which cannot be admitted in air: Beside these, I say, if we
consider the nature of aliment, and the proper use of air in
respiration, it will very hardly fall under the name hereof, or properly
attain the act of nutrication.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Requisites unto Nutrition.</i></div>

<p>And first concerning its nature, to make a perfect nutrition into the
body nourished, there is required a transmutation of the nutriment, now
where this conversion or aggeneration is made, there is also required in
the aliment a familiarity of matter, and such a community or vicinity
unto a living nature, as by one act of the soul may be converted into
the body of the living, and enjoy one common soul. Which cannot be
effected by air, it concurring only with our flesh in common principles,
which are at the largest distance from life, and common also unto
inanimated constitutions. And therefore when it is said by <i>Fernelius</i>,
and asserted by divers others, that we are only nourished by living
bodies, and such as are some way proceeding from them, that is, the
fruits, effects, parts, or seeds thereof; they have laid out an object
very agreeable unto assimulation; for these indeed are fit to receive a
quick and immediate conversion, as holding some community with our
selves, and containing approximate dispositions unto animation.</p>

<p>Secondly, (as is argued by <i>Aristotle</i> against the <i>Pythagoreans</i>)
whatsoever properly nourisheth before its assimulation, by the action of
natural heat it receiveth a corpulency or incrassation progressional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
unto its conversion; which notwithstanding cannot be effected upon air;
for the action of heat doth not condense but rarifie that body, and by
attenuation, rather then for nutrition, disposeth it for expulsion.</p>

<p>Thirdly, (which is the argument of <i>Hippocrates</i>) all aliment received
into the body, must be therein a considerable space retained, and not
immediately expelled. Now air but momentally remaining in our bodies, it
hath no proportionable space for its conversion; only of length enough
to refrigerate the heart; which having once performed, lest being it
self heated again, it should suffocate that part, it maketh no stay, but
hasteth back the same way it passed in.</p>

<p>Fourthly, The use of air attracted by the lungs, and without which there
is no durable continuation in life, is not the nutrition of parts, but
the contemperation and ventilation of that fire always maintained in the
forge of life; whereby although in some manner it concurreth unto
nutrition, yet can it not receive the proper name of nutriment. And
therefore by <i>Hippocrates</i><span class="sidenote15">De Alimento.</span> it is termed <i>Alimentum
non Alimentum</i>, a nourishment and no nourishment. That is, in a large
acception, but not in propriety of language; conserving the body, not
nourishing the same; nor repairing it by assimulation, but preserving it
by ventilation; for thereby the natural flame is preserved from
extinction, and so the individuum supported in some way like nutrition.</p>

<p>And though the air so entreth the Lungs, that by its nitrous Spirit doth
affect the heart, and several ways qualifie the blood; and though it be
also admitted into other parts, even by the meat we chew, yet that it
affordeth a proper nutriment alone, it is not easily made out.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Again, Some are so far from affirming the air to afford any nutriment,
that they plainly deny it to be any Element, or that it entreth into
mixt bodies as any principle in their compositions, but performeth other
offices in the Universe; as to fill all vacuities about the earth or
beneath it, to convey the heat of the sun, to maintain fires and flames,
to serve for the flight of volatils, respiration of breathing Animals,
and refrigeration of others. And although we receive it as an Element,
yet since the transmutation of Elements and simple bodies, is not beyond
great question, since also it is no easie matter to demonstrate that air
is so much as convertible into water;<span class="sidenote"><i>Wherein Vapour is commonly
mistaken for air.</i></span> how transmutable it is into flesh, may be of deeper
doubt.</p>

<p>And although the air attracted may be conceived to nourish the invisible
flame of life, in as much as common and culinary flames are nourished by
the air about them; we make some doubt whether air is the pabulous
supply of fire, much less that flame is properly air kindled. And the
same before us, hath been denied by the Lord of <i>Verulam</i>, in his Tract
of Life and Death, and also by Dr. <i>Jorden</i> in his book of Mineral
waters. <span class="sidenote"><i>What the matter of Culinary or Kitchin fire is.</i></span> For that
which substantially maintaineth the fire, is the combustible matter in
the kindled body, and not the ambient air, which affordeth exhalation to
its fuliginous atomes; nor that which causeth the flame properly to be
termed air, but rather as he expresseth it, the accension of fuliginous
exhalations, which contain an unctuosity in them, and arise from the
matter of fuel, which opinion will salve many doubts, whereof the common
conceit affordeth no solution.</p>

<p>As first, How fire is stricken out of flints? that is, not by kindling
the air from the collision of two hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span> bodies; for then Diamonds should
do the like better than Flints: but rather from sulphureous inflamed and
even vitrified effluviums and particles, as hath been observed of late.
The like saith <i>Jorden</i> we observe in canes and woods, that are unctuous
and full of oyl, which will yield fire by frication, or collision, not
by kindling the air about them, but the inflamable oyl within them.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Why fire goes out commonly wanting air, and why sometimes continued
many ages in flame without fuel.</i></span> Why the fire goes out without air?
that is, because the fuliginous exhalations wanting evaporation recoil
upon the flame and choak it, as is evident in cupping glasses; and the
artifice of charcoals, where if the air be altogether excluded, the fire
goes out. <a name="CORR2" id="CORR2"><ins class="correction" title="original: Why some lamps include in">Why some lamps included in</ins></a> those bodies have burned many
hundred years, as that discovered in the Sepulchre of <i>Tullia</i>, the
sister of <i>Cicero</i>, and that of <i>Olibius</i> many years after, near
<i>Padua</i>? because whatever was their matter, either a preparation of
gold, or <i>Naptha</i>, the duration proceeded from the purity of their oyl
which yielded no fuliginous exhalations to suffocate the fire; For if
air had nourished the flame, it had not continued many minutes, for it
would have been spent and wasted by the fire. Why a piece of flax will
kindle, though it touch not the flame? because the fire extendeth
further, then indeed it is visible, being at some distance from the
week, a pellucide and transparent body, and thinner then the air it
self. Why Mettals in their liquation, although they intensly heat the
air above their surface, arise not yet into a flame, nor kindle the air
about them? because their sulphur is more fixed, and they emit not
inflamable exhalations. And lastly, why a lamp or candle burneth only in
the air about it, and inflameth not the air at a distance from it?
because the flame extendeth not beyond the inflamable effluence, but
closely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span> adheres unto the original of its inflamation; and therefore it
only warmeth, not kindleth the air about it. Which notwithstanding it
will do, if the ambient air be impregnate with subtile inflamabilities,
and such as are of quick accension; as experiment is made in a close
room; upon an evaporation of spirits of wine and Camphire; as
subterraneous fires do sometimes happen, and as <i>Creusa</i> and
<i>Alexanders</i> boy in the bath were set on fire by <i>Naptha</i>.</p>

<p>Lastly, The Element of air is so far from nourishing the body, that some
have questioned the power of water; many conceiving it enters not the
body in the power of aliment, or that from thence there proceeds a
substantial supply. For beside that some creatures drink not at all;
Even unto our selves, and more perfect Animals, though many ways
assistent thereto, it performs no substantial nutrition, serving for
refrigeration, dilution of solid aliment, and its elixation in the
stomack; which from thence as a vehicle it conveys through less
accessible cavities, and so in a rorid substance through the capillary
cavities, into every part; which having performed, it is afterward
excluded by Urine, sweat and serous separations. And this opinion surely
possessed the Ancients; for when they so highly commended that water
which is suddenly hot and cold, which is without all savour, the
lightest, the thinnest, and which will soonest boil Beans or Pease, they
had no consideration of nutrition; whereunto had they had respect, they
would have surely commended gross and turbid streams, in whose confusion
at least, there might be contained some nutriment; and not jejune or
limped water, nearer the simplicity of its Element. Although, I confess,
our clearest waters and such as seem simple unto sense, are much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
compounded unto reason, as may be observed in the evaporation of large
quantities of water; wherein beside a terreous residence some salt is
also found, as is also observable in rain water; which appearing pure
and empty, is full of seminal principles, and carrieth vital atomes of
plants and Animals in it, which have not perished in the great
circulation of nature; <span class="sidenote"><i>A seed of

<p>All which considered, severer heads will be apt enough to conceive the
opinion of this Animal, not much unlike that of the Astomi, or men
without mouths, in <i>Pliny</i>; sutable unto the relation of the Mares in
<i>Spain</i>, and their subventaneous conceptions, from the Western wind; and
in some way more unreasonable then the figment of <i>Rabican</i> the famous
horse in <i>Ariosto</i>, which being conceived by flame and wind, never
tasted grass, or fed on any grosser provender then air; for this way of
nutrition was answerable unto the principles of his generation. Which
being not airy, but gross and seminal in the <i>Chameleon</i>; unto its
conservation there is required a solid pasture, and a food congenerous
unto the principles of its nature.</p>

<p>The grounds of this opinion are many; the first observed by
<i>Theophrastus</i>, was the inflation or swelling of the body, made in this
Animal upon inspiration or drawing in its breath; which people
observing, have thought it to feed upon air. But this effect is rather
occasioned upon the greatness of its lungs, which in this Animal are
very large, and by their backward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span> situation, afford a more observable
dilation; and though their lungs be less, the like inflation is also
observable in Toads, but especially in Sentortoises.</p>

<p>A second is the continual hiation or holding open its mouth, which men
observing, conceive the intention thereof to receive the aliment of air;
but this is also occasioned by the greatness of its lungs; for repletion
whereof not having a sufficient or ready supply by its nostrils; it is
enforced to dilate and hold open the jaws.</p>

<p>The third is the paucity of blood observed in this Animal, scarce at all
to be found but in the eye, and about the heart; which defect being
observed, inclined some into thoughts, that the air was a sufficient
maintenance for these exanguious parts. But this defect or rather
paucity of blood, is also agreeable unto many other Animals, whose solid
nutriment we do not controvert; as may be observed in other sorts of
Lizards, in Frogs and divers Fishes; and therefore an Horse-leech will
not readily fasten upon every fish; and we do not read of much blood
that was drawn from Frogs by Mice, in that famous battel of <i>Homer</i>.</p>

<p>The last and most common ground which begat or promoted this opinion, is
the long continuation hereof without any visible food, which some
observing, precipitously conclude they eat not at all. It cannot be
denied it is (if not the most of any) a very abstemious Animal, and such
as by reason of its frigidity, paucity of blood, and latitancy in the
winter (about which time the observations are often made) will long
subsist without a visible sustentation. But a like condition may be also
observed in many other Animals; for Lizards and Leeches, as we have made
trial, will live some months without sustenance; and we have included<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Snails in glasses all winter, which have returned to feed again in the
spring. Now these notwithstanding, are not conceived to pass all their
lives without food; for so to argue is fallacious, and is moreover
sufficiently convicted by experience. And therefore probably other
relations are of the same verity, which are of the like affinity; as is
the conceit of the <i>Rhintace</i> in <i>Persia</i>, the <i>Canis Levis</i> of
<i>America</i>, and the <i>Manucodiata</i> or bird of Paradise in <i>India</i>.</p>

<p>To assign a reason of this abstinence in Animals, or declare how without
a supply there ensueth no destructive exhaustion, exceedeth the limits
and intention of my discourse. <i>Fortunius Licetus</i> in his excellent
Tract, <i>de his qui diu vivunt sine alimento</i>, hath very ingeniously
attempted it; deducing the cause hereof from an equal conformity of
natural heat and moisture, at least no considerable exuperancy in
either; which concurring in an unactive proportion, the natural heat
consumeth not the moisture (whereby ensueth no exhaustion) and the
condition of natural moisture is able to resist the slender action of
heat (whereby it needeth no reparation) and this is evident in Snakes,
Lizards, Snails, and divers Insects latitant many months in the year;
which being cold creatures, containing a weak heat in a crass or copious
humidity, do long subsist without nutrition. For the activity of the
agent, being not able to overmaster the resistance of the patient, there
will ensue no deperdition. And upon the like grounds it is, that cold
and phlegmatick bodies, and (as <i>Hippocrates</i> determineth) that old men
will best endure fasting. Now the same harmony and stationary
constitution, as it happeneth in many species, so doth it fall out
sometime in Individuals. For we read of many who have lived long without
aliment; and beside deceits and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span> impostures, there may be veritable
Relations of some, who without a miracle, and by peculiarity of temper,
have far out fasted <i>Elias</i>. Which notwithstanding doth not take off the
miracle; for that may be miraculously effected in one, which is
naturally causable in another. Some naturally living unto an hundred;
unto which age, others notwithstanding could not attain without a
miracle.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII_PE_III" id="CHAPTER_XXII_PE_III">CHAPTER XXII</a>
<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of the Ostrich.</span></h2>


<p>The common opinion of the <i>Ostrich</i>, <i>Struthiocamelus</i> or
<i>Sparrow-Camel</i> conceives that it digesteth Iron; and this is confirmed
by the affirmations of many; beside swarms of others, <i>Rhodiginus</i> in
his prelections taketh it for granted, <i>Johannes Langius</i> in his
Epistles pleadeth experiment for it; the common picture also confirmeth
it, which usually describeth this Animal with an horshoe in its mouth.
Notwithstanding upon enquiry we find it very questionable, and the
negative seems most reasonably entertained; whose verity indeed we do
the rather desire, because hereby we shall relieve our ignorance of one
occult quality; for in the list thereof it is accounted, and in that
notion imperiously obtruded upon us. For my part, although I have had
the sight of this Animal, I have not had the opportunity of its
experiment, but have received great occasion of doubt, from learned
discourses thereon.</p>

<p>For <i>Aristotle</i> and <i>Oppianus</i> who have particularly treated hereof are
silent in this singularity; either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span> omitting it as dubious, or as the
Comment saith, rejecting it as fabulous. <i>Pliny</i> speaketh generally,
affirming only, the digestion is wonderful in this Animal; <i>√Ülian</i>
delivereth, that it digesteth stones without any mention of Iron; <i>Leo
Africanus</i>, who lived in those Countries wherein they most abound,
speaketh diminutively, and but half way into this assertion: <i>Surdum ac
simplex animal est, quicquid invenit, absque delectu, usque ad ferrum
devorat</i>: <i>Fernelius</i> in his second <i>De abditis rerum causis</i>,
extenuates it, and <i>Riolanus</i> in his Comment thereof positively denies
it. Some have experimentally refuted it, as <i>Albertus Magnus</i>; and most
plainly <i>Ulysses Aldrovandus</i>, whose words are these: <i>Ego ferri frusta
devorare, dum Tridenti essem, observavi, sed qu√¶ incocta rursus
excerneret</i>, that is, at my being at Trent, I observed the <i>Ostrich</i> to
swallow Iron, but yet to exclude it undigested again.</p>

<p>Now beside experiment, it is in vain to attempt against it by
Philosophical argument, it being an occult quality, which contemns the
law of Reason, and defends it self by admitting no reason at all.
<span class="sidenote"><i>How</i> (<i>possibly</i>) <i>the stomack of the</i> Ostrich <i>may alter Iron</i>.</span> As
for its possibility we shall not at present dispute; nor will we affirm
that Iron ingested, receiveth in the stomack of the <i>Ostrich</i> no
alteration at all; but if any such there be, we suspect this effect
rather from some way of corrosion, then any of digestion; not any liquid
reduction or tendance to chilification by the power of natural heat, but
rather some attrition from an acide and vitriolous humidity in the
stomack, which may absterse and shave the scorious parts thereof. So
rusty Iron crammed down the throat of a Cock, will become terse and
clear again in its gizzard: So the Counter which according to the
relation of <i>Amatus</i> remained a whole year in the body of a youth, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
came out much consumed at last; might suffer this diminution, rather
from sharp and acide humours, then the strength of natural heat, as he
supposeth. So silver swallowed and retained some time in the body, will
turn black, as if it had been dipped in <i>Aqua fortis</i>, or some corrosive
water, but Lead will remain unaltered; for that mettal containeth in it
a sweet salt or sugar, whereby it resisteth ordinary corrosion, and will
not easily dissolve even in <i>Aqua fortis</i>. So when for medical uses, we
take down the filings of Iron or Steel, we must not conceive it passeth
unaltered from us; for though the grosser parts be excluded again, yet
are the dissoluble parts extracted, whereby it becomes effectual in
deopilations; and therefore for speedier operation we make extinctions,
infusions, and the like, whereby we extract the salt and active parts of
the Medicine; which being in solution, more easily enter the veins.
<span class="sidenote"><i>What the Chymists would have by their</i> Aurum Potabile.</span> And this is
that the Chymists mainly drive at in the attempt of their <i>Aurum
Potabile</i>; that is, to reduce that indigestible substance into such a
form as may not be ejected by siege, but enter the cavities, and less
accessible parts of the body, without corrosion.</p>

<p>The ground of this conceit is its swallowing down fragments of Iron,
which men observing, by a froward illation, have therefore conceived it
digesteth them; which is an inference not to be admitted, as being a
fallacy of the consequent, that is, concluding a position of the
consequent, from the position of the antecedent. For many things are
swallowed by Animals, rather for condiment, gust or medicament, then any
substantial nutriment. So Poultrey, and especially the Turkey, do of
themselves take down stones; and we have found at one time in the
gizzard of a Turkey no less then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span> seven hundred. Now these rather concur
unto digestion, then are themselves digested; for we have found them
also in the guts and excrements; but their descent is very slow, for we
have given them stones and small pieces of Iron, which eighteen days
after we have found remaining in the gizzard. And therefore the
experiment of <i>Langius</i> and others might be fallible, whilst after the
taking they expected it should come down within a day or two after.
<span class="sidenote"><i>How Cherry-stones may be thought to prevent surfets upon eating
Cherries.</i></span> Thus also we swallow Cherry-stones, but void them
unconcocted, and we usually say they preserve us from surfet; for being
hard bodies they conceive a strong and durable heat in the stomack, and
so prevent the crudities of their fruit: And upon the like reason do
culinary operators observe, that flesh boiles best, when the bones are
boiled with it. Thus dogs will eat grass, which they digest not: Thus
Camels to make the water sapid, do raise the mud with their feet: Thus
horses will knable at walls, Pigeons delight in salt stones. Rats will
gnaw iron, and <i>Aristotle</i> saith the Elephant swalloweth stones. And
thus may also the <i>Ostrich</i> swallow Iron; not as his proper aliment, but
for the ends above expressed, and even as we observe the like in other
Animals.</p>

<p>And whether these fragments of Iron and hard substances swallowed by the
<i>Ostrich</i>, have not also that use in their stomacks, which they have in
other birds; that is, in some way to supply the use of teeth, by
commolition, grinding and compression of their proper aliment, upon the
action of the strongly conformed muscles of the stomack; as the honor&rsquo;d
Dr. <i>Harvey</i> discourseth, may also be considered.</p>

<p>What effect therefore may be expected from the stomack of an <i>Ostrich</i>
by application alone to further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span> digestion in ours, beside the
experimental refute of <i>Galen</i>, we refer it unto considerations above
alledged; Or whether there be any more credit to be given unto the
Medicine of <i>√Ülian</i>, who affirms the stones they swallow have a peculiar
vertue for the eyes, then that of <i>Hermolaus</i> and <i>Pliny</i> drawn from the
urine of this Animal; let them determine who can swallow so strange a
transmission of qualities, or believe that any Bird or flying Animal
doth separately and distinctly urine beside the Bat.</p>

<p>That therefore an <i>Ostrich</i> will swallow and take down Iron, is easily
to be granted: that oftimes it pass entire away, if we admit of ocular
testimony not to be denied. And though some experiment may also plead,
that sometimes they are so altered, as not to be found or excluded in
any discernable parcels: yet whether this be not effected by some way of
corrosion, from sharp and dissolving humidities, rather then any proper
digestion, chilifactive mutation, or alimental conversion, is with good
reason doubted.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII_PE_III" id="CHAPTER_XXIII_PE_III">CHAPTER XXIII</a>
<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of Unicorns Horn.</span></h2>


<p>Great account and much profit is made of <i>Unicorns horn</i>, at least of
that which beareth the name thereof; wherein notwithstanding, many I
perceive suspect an Imposture, and some conceive there is no such Animal
extant. Herein therefore to draw up our determinations; beside the
several places of Scripture mentioning this Animal (which some may well
contend to be only meant of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span> Rhinoceros <span class="sidenote15"><i>Some doubt to be made
what</i> ◊®◊ê◊ù <i>signifieth in Scripture</i>.</span>) we are so far from denying there
is any <i>Unicorn</i> at all, that we affirm there are many kinds thereof. In
the number of Quadrupedes, we will concede no less then five; that is,
the <i>Indian</i> Ox, the <i>Indian</i> Ass, the Rhinoceros, the Oryx, and that
which is more eminently termed <i>Monoceros</i>, or <i>Unicornis</i>. Some of the
list of fishes; as that described by <i>Olaus</i>, <i>Albertus</i> and others: and
some Unicorns we will allow even among Insects; as those four kinds of
nasicornous Beetles described by <i>Muffetus</i>.</p>

<p>Secondly, Although we concede there may be many <i>Unicorns</i>, yet are we
still to seek; for whereunto to affix this Horn in question, or to
determine from which thereof we receive this magnified Medicine, we have
no assurance, or any satisfactory decision. For although we single out
one, and eminently thereto assign the name of the <i>Unicorn</i>; yet can we
not be secure what creature is meant thereby; what constant shape it
holdeth, or in what number to be received. For as far as our endeavours
discover, this animal is not uniformly described, but differently set
forth by those that undertake it. <span class="sidenote"><i>The Unicorn, how variously
reported by Authors.</i></span> <i>Pliny</i> affirmeth it is a fierce and terrible
creature; <i>Vartomannus</i> a tame and mansuete Animal: those which <i>Garcias
ab Horto</i> described about the cape of good hope, were beheld with heads
like horses; those which <i>Vartomannus</i> beheld, he described with the
head of a Deer; <i>Pliny</i>, <i>√Ülian</i>, <i>Solinus</i>, and after these from ocular
assurance, <i>Paulus Venetus</i> affirmeth, the feet of the <i>Unicorn</i> are
undivided, and like the Elephants: But those two which <i>Vartomannus</i>
beheld at <i>Mecha</i>, were as he describeth, footed like a Goat. As <i>√Ülian</i>
describeth, it is in the bigness of an Horse, as <i>Vartomannus</i>, of a
Colt; that which <i>Thevet</i> speaketh of was not so big as an Heifer; but
<i>Paulus Venetus</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span> affirmeth, they are but little less then Elephants.
Which are discriminations very material, and plainly declare, that under
the same name Authors describe not the same Animal: so that the
<i>Unicorns</i> Horn of one, is not that of another, although we proclaim an
equal vertue in all.</p>

<p>Thirdly, Although we were agreed what Animal this was, or differed not
in its description, yet would this also afford but little satisfaction;
for the Horn we commonly extol, is not the same with that of the
Ancients. For that in the description of <i>√Ülian</i> and <i>Pliny</i> was black:
this which is shewed amongst us is commonly white, none black; and of
those five which <i>Scaliger</i> beheld, though one spadiceous, or of a light
red, and two enclining to red, yet was there not any of this complexion
among them.</p>

<p>Fourthly, What Horns soever they be which pass amongst us, they are not
surely the Horns of any one kind of Animal, but must proceed from
several sorts of <i>Unicorns</i>. For some are wreathed, some not: That
famous one which is preserved at St. <i>Dennis</i> near <i>Paris</i>, hath wreathy
spires, and chocleary turnings about it, which agreeth with the
description of the <i>Unicorns</i> Horn in <i>√Ülian</i>. Those two in the treasure
of St. <i>Mark</i> are plain, and best accord with those of the <i>Indian</i> Ass,
or the descriptions of other <i>Unicorns</i>: That in the Repository of the
electour of Saxone is plain and not hollow, and is believed to be a true
Land <i>Unicorns</i> Horn. <i>Albertus Magnus</i> describeth one ten foot long,
and at the base about thirteen inches compass: And that of <i>Antwerp</i>
which <i>Goropius Becanus</i> describeth, is not much inferiour unto it;
which best agree unto the descriptions of the <i>Sea-Unicorns</i>; for these,
as <i>Olaus</i> affirmeth, are of that strength and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span> bigness, as able to
penetrate the ribs of ships. The same is more probable, because it was
brought from Island, from whence, as <i>Becanus</i> affirmeth, three other
were brought in his days: And we have heard of some which have been
found by the Sea-side, and brought unto us from <i>America</i>. So that while
we commend the <i>Unicorns</i> Horn, and conceive it peculiar but unto one
animal; under apprehension of the same vertue, we use very many; and
commend that effect from all, which every one confineth unto some one he
hath either seen or described.</p>

<p>Fifthly, Although there be many <i>Unicorns</i>, and consequently many Horns,
yet many there are which bear that name, and currantly pass among us,
which are no Horns at all. Such are those fragments and pieces of <i>Lapis
Ceratites</i>, commonly termed <i>Cornu fossile</i>, whereof <i>B≈ìtius</i> had no
less than twenty several sorts presented him for <i>Unicorns</i> Horn. Hereof
in subterraneous cavities, and under the earth there are many to be
found in several parts of <i>Germany</i>; which are but the lapidescencies
and petrifactive mutations of hard bodies; sometimes of Horn, of teeth,
of bones, and branches of trees, whereof there are some so imperfectly
converted, as to retain the odor and qualities of their originals; as he
relateth of pieces of Ash and Walnut. Again, in most, if not all which
pass amongst us, and are extolled for precious Horns, we discover not an
affection common unto other Horns; that is, they mollifie not with fire,
they soften not upon decoction or infusion, nor will they afford a
jelly, or mucilaginous concretion in either; which notwithstanding we
may effect in Goats horns, Sheeps, Cows and Harts-horn, in the Horn of
the <i>Rhinoceros</i>, the horn of the Pristis or Sword fish. Nor do they
become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span> friable or easily powderable by Philosophical calcination, that
is, from the vapor or steam of water, but split and rift contrary to
others horns. <span class="sidenote">Unicorns <i>Horn commonly used in</i> England, <i>what it
is</i>.</span> Briefly, many of those commonly received, and whereof there be so
many fragments preserved in <i>England</i>, are not only no Horn, but a
substance harder then a bone, that is, parts of the tooth of a Morse or
Sea-horse; in the midst of the solider part contained a curdled grain,
which is not to be found in Ivory. This in Northern Regions is of
frequent use for hafts of knives or hilts of swords, and being burnt
becomes a good remedy for fluxes: but Antidotally used, and exposed for
<i>Unicorns</i> Horn, it is an insufferable delusion; and with more veniable
deceit, it might have been practised in Harts-horn.</p>

<p>The like deceit may be practised in the teeth of other Sea-animals; in
the teeth also of the <i>Hippopotamus</i>, or great Animal which frequenteth
the River <i>Nilus</i>: For we read that the same was anciently used instead
of Ivory or Elephants tooth. Nor is it to be omitted, what hath been
formerly suspected, but now confirmed by <i>Olaus Wormius</i>, and <i>Thomas
Bartholinus</i> and others, that those long Horns preserved as pretious
rarities in many places, are but the teeth of <a name="CORR3" id="CORR3"><ins class="correction" title="sic">Narhwales</ins></a>, to be found
about Island, Greenland and other Northern regions; of many feet long,
commonly wreathed, very deeply fastned in the upper jaw, and standing
directly forward, graphically described in <i>Bartholinus</i><span class="sidenote15">De
Unicornu.</span>, according unto one sent from a Bishop of Island, not
separated from the crany. Hereof <i>Mercator</i> hath taken notice in his
description of Island: some relations hereof there seem to be in
<i>Purchas</i>, who also delivereth that the Horn at <i>Windsor</i>, was in his
second voyage brought hither by <i>Frobisher</i>. These before the Northern
dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>coveries, as unknown rarities, were carried by Merchants into all
parts of <i>Europe</i>; and though found on the Sea-shore, were sold at very
high rates; but are now become more common, and probably in time will
prove of little esteem; and the bargain of <i>Julius</i> the third, be
accounted a very hard one, who stuck not to give many thousand crowns
for one.</p>

<p>Nor is it great wonder we may be so deceived in this, being daily gulled
in the brother Antidote Bezoar; whereof though many be false, yet one
there passeth amongst us of more intollerable delusion; somewhat paler
then the true stone, and given by women in the extremity of great
diseases, which notwithstanding is no stone, but seems to be the stony
seed of some Lithospermum or greater Grumwell; or the Lobus Echinatus of
<i>Clusius</i>, called also the Bezoar Nut; for being broken, it discovereth
a kernel of a leguminous smell and tast, bitter like a Lupine, and will
swell and sprout if set in the ground, and therefore more serviceable
for issues, then dangerous and virulent diseases.</p>

<p>Sixthly, Although we were satisfied we had the <i>Unicorns</i> Horn, yet were
it no injury unto reason to question the efficacy thereof, or whether
those vertues pretended do properly belong unto it. For what we observe,
(and it escaped not the observation of <i>Paulus Jovius</i> many years past)
none of the Ancients ascribed any medicinal or antidotal vertue unto the
<i>Unicorns</i> Horn; and that which <i>√Ülian</i> extolleth, who was the first and
only man of the Ancients who spake of the medical vertue of any
<i>Unicorn</i>, was the Horn of the <i>Indian</i> Ass; whereof, saith he, the
Princes of those parts make bowls and drink therein, as preservatives
against Poyson, Convulsions, and the Falling-sickness. Now the
description of that Horn is not agreeable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span> unto that we commend; for
that (saith he) is red above, white below, and black in the middle;
which is very different from ours, or any to be seen amongst us. And
thus, though the description of the <i>Unicorn</i> be very ancient, yet was
there of old no vertue ascribed unto it; and although this amongst us
receive the opinion of the same vertue, yet is it not the same Horn
whereunto the Antients ascribed it.</p>

<p>Lastly, Although we allow it an Antidotal efficacy, and such as the
Ancients commended, yet are there some vertues ascribed thereto by
Moderns not easily to be received; and it hath surely faln out in this,
as other magnified medicines, whose operations effectual in some
diseases, are presently extended unto all. That some Antidotal quality
it may have, we have no reason to deny; for since Elks Hoofs and Horns
are magnified for Epilepsies, since not only the bone in the heart, but
the Horn of a Deer is Alexipharmacal, and ingredient into the confection
of Hyacinth, and the Electuary of Maximilian; we cannot without
prejudice except against the efficacy of this. <span class="sidenote"><i>Expulsive of
Poisons.</i></span> But when we affirm it is not only Antidotal to proper venoms,
and substances destructive by qualities we cannot express; but that it
resisteth also Sublimate, Arsenick, and poysons which kill by second
qualities, that is, by corrosion of parts; I doubt we exceed the
properties of its nature, and the promises of experiment will not secure
the adventure. And therefore in such extremities, whether there be not
more probable relief from fat oyly substances, which are the open
tyrants over salt and corrosive bodies, then precious and cordial
medicines which operate by secret and disputable proprieties; or whether
he that swallowed Lime, and drank down Mercury water, did not more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
reasonably place his cure in milk, butter or oyl, then if he had
recurred unto Pearl and Bezoar, common reason at all times, and
necessity in the like case would easily determine.</p>

<p>Since therefore there be many <i>Unicorns</i>; since that whereto we
appropriate a Horn is so variously described, that it seemeth either
never to have been seen by two persons, or not to have been one animal;
Since though they agreed in the description of the animal, yet is not
the Horn we extol the same with that of the Ancients; Since what Horns
soever they be that pass among us, they are not the Horns of one, but
several animals; Since many in common use and high esteem are no Horns
at all; Since if there were true Horns, yet might their vertues be
questioned; Since though we allowed some vertues, yet were not others to
be received; with what security a man may rely on this remedy, the
mistress of fools hath already instructed some, and to wisdom (which is
never to wise to learn) it is not too late to consider.</p>

<br /><span class="subtitle90">That all Animals of the Land, are in their
<br />kind in the Sea.</span></h2>


<p>That all Animals of the Land, are in their kind in the Sea, although
received as a principle, is a tenent very questionable, and will admit
of restraint. For some in the Sea are not to be matcht by any enquiry at
Land, and hold those shapes which terrestrious forms approach not; as
may be observed in the Moon-fish, or Orthragoriscus, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span> several sorts

<p>Again, Though many there be which make out their nominations, as the

some are called the Fox, the Dog, the Sparrow or Frog-fish: and are
known by common names with those at Land; yet as their describers
attest, they receive not these appellations from a total similitude in
figure, but any concurrence in common accidents, in colour, condition or
single conformation. As for Sea-horses which much confirm this
assertion; in their common descriptions, they are but Crotesco
deliniations which fill up empty spaces in Maps, and meer pictorial
inventions, not any Physical shapes: sutable unto those which (as
<i>Pliny</i> delivereth) <i>Praxiteles</i> long ago set out in the Temple of
<i>Domitius</i>. For that which is commonly called a Sea-horse, is properly
called a Morse, and makes not out that shape. That which the Ancients
named <i>Hippocampus</i> is a little animal about six inches long, and not
preferred beyond the classis of Insects. That which they termed
<i>Hippopotamus</i> an amphibious animal, about the River <i>Nile</i>, so little
resembleth an horse, that as <i>Mathiolus</i> observeth, in all except the
feet, it better makes out a swine. That which they termed a Lion, was
but a kind of Lobster: that which they called the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span> Bear, was but one
kind of Crab: and that which they named <i>Bos marinus</i>, was not as we
conceive a fish resembling an Ox, but a Skait or Thornback, so named
from its bigness, expressed by the Greek word <i>Bous</i>, which is a prefix
of augmentation to many words in that language.</p>

<p>And therefore although it be not denied that some in the water do carry
a justifiable resemblance to some at Land, yet are the major part which
bear their names unlike; nor do they otherwise resemble the creatures on
earth, then they on earth the constellations which pass under animal
names in heaven: nor the Dog fish at Sea much more make out the Dog of
the Land, then that his cognominal or name-sake in the heavens. Now if
from a similitude in some, it be reasonable to infer a correspondence in
all, we may draw this analogy of animals upon plants; for vegetables
there are which carry a near and allowable similitude unto animals.
<span class="sidenote">Fab. column. de stirp. rarioribus, Orchis, Cercopithecophora,
Anthropophora.</span> We might also conclude that animal shapes were generally
made out in minerals: for several stones there are that bear their names
in relation to animals or their parts, as <i>Lapis anguinus</i>, <i>Conchites</i>,
<i>Echinites</i>, <i>Encephalites, √Ügopthalmus</i>, and many more; as will appear
in the Writers of Minerals, and especially in <i>B≈ìtius</i> and
<i>Aldrovandus</i>.</p>

<p>Moreover if we concede, that the animals of one Element, might bear the
names of those in the other, yet in strict reason the watery productions
should have the prenomination: and they of the land rather derive their
names, then nominate those of the Sea. For the watery plantations were
first existent, and as they enjoyed a priority in form, had also in
nature precedent denominations: but falling not under that Nomenclature
of <i>Adam</i>, which unto terrestrious animals as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>signed a name appropriate
unto their natures: from succeeding spectators they received arbitrary
appellations: and were respectively denominated unto creatures known at
Land; who in themselves had independent names and not to be called after
them, which were created before them.</p>

<p>Lastly, By this assertion we restrain the hand of God, and abridge the
variety of the creation; making the creatures of one Element, but an
acting over those of another, and conjoyning as it were the species of
things which stood at distance in the intellect of God; and though
united in the Chaos, had several seeds of their creation. For although
in that indistinguisht mass, all things seemed one; yet separated by the
voice of God, according to their species, they came out in
incommunicated varieties, and irrelative seminalities, as well as
divided places; and so although we say the world was made in six days,
yet was there as it were a world in every one; that is, a distinct
creation of distinguisht creatures; a distinction in time of creatures
divided in nature, and a several approbation and survey in every one.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV_PE_III" id="CHAPTER_XXV_PE_III">CHAPTER XXV</a></h2>
<p class="hang">Concerning the common course of Diet, in
making choice of some Animals, and abstaining
from eating others.</p>


<p>Why we confine our food unto certain Animals, and totally reject some
others; how these distinctions crept into several Nations; and whether
this practice be built upon solid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span> reason, or chiefly supported by
custom or opinion; may admit consideration.</p>

<p>For first there is no absolute necessity to feed on any; and if we
resist not the stream of Authority, and several diductions from holy
Scripture: there was no <i>Sarcophagie</i> before the flood; <span class="sidenote"><i>Eating of
Flesh.</i></span> and without the eating of flesh, our fathers from vegetable
aliments, preserved themselves unto longer lives, then their posterity
by any other. For whereas it is plainly said<span class="sidenote15">Gen. 1. 29.</span>, I have
given you every herb which is upon the face of all the earth, and every
tree, to you it shall be for meat; <span class="sidenote"><i>The natural vertue of
vegetables impaired by the deluge.</i></span> presently after the deluge, when
the same had destroyed or infirmed the nature of vegetables, by an
expression of enlargement, it is again delivered:<span class="sidenote10">Gen. 9. 3.</span> Every
moving thing that liveth, shall be meat for you, even as the green herb,
have I given you all things.</p>

<p>And therefore although it be said that <i>Abel</i> was a Shepherd, and it be
not readily conceived, the first men would keep sheep, except they made
food thereof: great Expositors will tell us, that it was partly for
their skins, wherewith they were cloathed, partly for their milk,
whereby they were sustained; and partly for Sacrifices, which they also
offered.</p>

<p>And though it may seem improbable, that they offered flesh, yet eat not
thereof; and <i>Abel</i> can hardly be said to offer the firstlings of his
flock, and the fat or acceptable part, if men used not to tast the same,
whereby to raise such distinctions: some will confine the eating of
flesh unto the line of <i>Cain</i>, who extended their luxury, and confined
not unto the rule of God. That if at any time the line of <i>Seth</i> eat
flesh, it was extraordinary, and only at their sacrifices; or else (as
<i>Grotius</i> hinteth) if any such practice there were, it was not from the
beginning; but from that time when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span> waies of men were corrupted, and
whereof it is said, that the wickedness of mans heart was great; the
more righteous part of mankind probably conforming unto the diet
prescribed in Paradise, and the state of innocency. <span class="sidenote"><i>Eating
of Flesh (probably) not so common before the flood.</i></span> And yet however
the practice of men conformed, this was the injunction of God, and might
be therefore sufficient, without the food of flesh.</p>

<p>That they fed not on flesh, at least the faithful party before the
flood, may become more probable, because they refrained the same for
some time after. For so was it generally delivered of the golden age and
reign of <i>Saturn</i>; which is conceived the time of <i>Noah</i>, before the
building of <i>Babel</i>. And he that considereth how agreeable this is unto
the traditions of the <i>Gentiles</i>; that that age was of one tongue: that
<i>Saturn</i> devoured all his sons but three; that he was the son of
<i>Oceanus</i> and <i>Thetis</i>; that a Ship was his Symbole; that he taught the
culture of vineyards, and the art of husbandry, and was therefore
described with a sickle, may well conceive, these traditions had their
original in <i>Noah</i>. Nor did this practice terminate in him, but was
continued at least in many after: as (beside the <i>Pythagoreans</i> of old,
<i>Bannyans</i> now in <i>India</i>, who upon single opinions refrain the food of
flesh) ancient records do hint or plainly deliver. Although we descend
not so low, as that of <i>√Üsclepiades</i> delivered by <i>Porphyrius</i>, <span class="sidenote15">œÄŒµœÅ·Ω∂
·ºÄœÄŒøœá·øÜœÇ.</span> that men began to feed on flesh in the raign of <i>Pygmaleon</i>
brother of <i>Dido</i>, who invented several torments, to punish the eaters
of flesh.</p>

<p>Nor did men only refrain from the flesh of beasts at first, but as some
will have it, beasts from one another. And if we should believe very
grave conjecturers, carnivorous animals now, were not flesh devourers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
then, according to the expression of the divine provision for them.
<span class="sidenote15">Gen. 1. 36.</span> To every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air,
I have given every green herb for meat, and it was so. As is also
collected from the store laid up in the Ark; wherein there seems to have
been no fleshly provision for carnivorous Animals. For of every kind of
unclean beast there went but two into the Ark: and therefore no stock of
flesh to sustain them many days, much less almost a year.</p>

<p>But when ever it be acknowledged that men began to feed on flesh, yet
how they betook themselves after to particular kinds thereof, with
rejection of many others, is a point not clearly determined. As for the
distinction of clean and unclean beasts, the original is obscure, and
salveth not our practice. For no Animal is naturally unclean, or hath
this character in nature; and therefore whether in this distinction
there were not some mystical intention: <span class="sidenote"><i>How</i> Moses <i>might
distinguish beasts into clean and unclean before the flood</i>.</span> whether
<i>Moses</i> after the distinction made of unclean beasts, did not name these
so before the flood by anticipation: whether this distinction before the
flood, were not only in regard of sacrifices, as that delivered after
was in regard of food: (for many were clean for food, which were unclean
for sacrifice) or whether the denomination were but comparative, and of
beasts less commodious for food, although not simply bad, is not yet
resolved.</p>

<p>And as for the same distinction in the time of <i>Moses</i>, long after the
flood, from thence we hold no restriction, as being no rule unto Nations
beside the <i>Jews</i> in dietetical consideration, or natural choice of
diet, they being enjoyned or prohibited certain foods upon remote and
secret intentions. Especially thereby to avoid community with the
Gentiles upon promiscuous commensality: or to divert them from the
Idolatry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span> of <i>Egypt</i> whence they came, they were enjoyned to eat the
Gods of <i>Egypt</i> in the food of Sheep and Oxen. Withall in this
distinction of Animals the consideration was hieroglyphical; in the
bosom and inward sense implying an abstinence from certain vices
symbolically intimated from the nature of those animals; as may be well
made out in the prohibited meat of Swine, Cony, Owl, and many more.</p>

<p>At least the intention was not medical, or such as might oblige unto
conformity or imitation; For some we refrain which that Law alloweth, as
Locusts and many others; and some it prohibiteth, which are accounted
good meat in strict and Medical censure: as (beside many fishes which
have not finns and scales,) the Swine, Cony and Hare, a dainty dish with
the Ancients; as is delivered by <i>Galen</i>, testified by <i>Martial</i>,
<span class="sidenote">Inter quadrupedes mattya prima Lepus.</span> as the popular opinion implied,
that men grew fair by the flesh thereof: by the diet of <i>Cato</i>, that is
Hare and Cabbage; and the <i>Jus nigrum</i>, or Black broath of the
<i>Spartans</i>, which was made with the blood and bowels of an Hare.</p>

<p>And if we take a view of other Nations, we shall discover that they
refrained many meats upon the like considerations. For in some the
abstinence was symbolical; so <i>Pythagoras</i> enjoyned abstinence from
fish: that is, luxurious and dainty dishes; So according to <i>Herodotus</i>,
some <i>Egyptians</i> refrained swines flesh, as an impure and sordid animal:
which whoever but touched, was fain to wash himself.</p>

<p>Some abstained superstitiously or upon religious consideration: So the
<i>Syrians</i> refrained Fish and Pigeons; the <i>Egyptians</i> of old, Dogs,
Eeles and Crocodiles; though <i>Leo Africanus</i> delivers, that many of
late, do eat them with good gust: and <i>Herodotus</i> also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span> affirmeth, that
the <i>Egyptians</i> of <i>Elephantina</i> (unto whom they were not sacred,) did
eat thereof in elder times: and Writers testify, that they are eaten at
this day in <i>India</i> and <i>America</i>. And so, as <i>C√¶sar</i> reports,
<span class="sidenote15">Lib. 3. de bello Gall.</span> unto the ancient <i>Britains</i> it was piaculous to tast
a Goose, which dish at present no table is without.</p>

<p>Unto some Nations the abstinence was political and for some civil
advantage: So the <i>Thessalians</i> refrained Storks, because they destroyed
their Serpents; and the like in sundry animals is observable in other
Nations.</p>

<p>And under all these considerations were some animals refrained: so the
<i>Jews</i> abstained from swine at first symbolically, as an Emblem of
impurity; and not for fear of the Leprosie, as <i>Tacitus</i> would put upon
them. The <i>Cretians</i> superstitiously, upon tradition that <i>Jupiter</i> was
suckled in that countrey by a Sow. Some <i>Egyptians</i> politically, because
they supplyed the labour of plowing by rooting up the ground. And upon
like considerations perhaps the <i>Ph≈ìnicians</i> and <i>Syrians</i> fed not on
this Animal: and as <i>Solinus</i> reports, the <i>Arabians</i> also and
<i>Indians</i>. <span class="sidenote"><i>Aul. Gell.</i> lib. 4.</span>A great part of mankind refraining one of the best foods, and
such as <i>Pythagoras</i> himself would eat; who, as <i>Aristoxenus</i> records,
 refused not to feed on Pigs.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Certain dishes in great request with the Ancients, not so
much esteemed now.</i></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p><p>Moreover while we single out several dishes and reject others, the
selection seems but arbitrary, or upon opinion; for many are commended
and cryed up in one age, which are decryed and nauseated in another.
Thus in the dayes of <i>Mecenas</i>, no flesh was preferred before young
Asses; which notwithstanding became abominable unto succeeding
appetites. At the table of <i>Heliogabalus</i> the combs of Cocks were an
esteemed service; which country stomacks will not admit at ours. The
Sumen or belly and dugs of swine with Pig, and sometimes beaten and
bruised unto death: the womb of the same Animal, especially that was
barren, or else had cast her young ones, though a tough and membranous
part, was magnified by Roman Palats; whereunto nevertheless we cannot
perswade our stomacks. How <i>Alec</i>, <i>Muria</i>, and <i>Garum</i>, would humour
our gust I know not; but surely few there are that could delight in
their <i>Cyceon</i>; that is, the common draught of Honey, Cheese, parcht
Barley-flower, Oyl and Wine; which notwithstanding was commended
mixture, and in high esteem among them. We mortifie our selves with the
diet of fish, and think we fare coursly if we refrain from the flesh of
other animals. But antiquity held another opinion hereof: When
<i>Pythagoras</i> in prevention of luxury advised, not so much as to tast on
fish. Since the <i>Rhodians</i> were wont to call them clowns that eat flesh:
and since <i>Plato</i> to evidence the temperance of the noble <i>Greeks</i>
before <i>Troy</i>, observed, that it was not found they fed on fish, though
they lay so long near the <i>Hellespont</i>;<span class="sidenote10">Odyss. 4‚Å∞.</span> and was only
observed in the companions of <i>Menelaus</i>, that being almost starved,
betook themselves to fishing about <i>Pharos</i>.</p>

<p>Nor will (I fear) the attest or prescript of Philosophers and
Physitians, be a sufficient ground to confirm or warrant common
practice, as is deducible from ancient Writers, from <i>Hippocrates</i>,
<i>Galen</i>, <i>Simeon</i>, <i>Sethi</i>: and the later tracts of <i>Nonnus</i><span class="sidenote"> <i>Non</i>
de re cibaria.</span> and <i>Castellanus</i>.<span class="sidenote"><i>Cast.</i> de esu carnium.</span> So
<i>Aristotle</i> and <i>Albertus</i> commend the flesh of young Hawks:
<i>Galen</i><span class="sidenote"><i>Gal.</i> Alim. fac. lib. 3.</span> when they feed on Grapes: but
condemneth Quails, and ranketh Geese but with Ostriches; which
notwithstanding, present practice and every table extolleth. Men think
they have fared hardly, if in times of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span> extremity they have descended so
low as Dogs: but <i>Galen</i> delivereth<span class="sidenote"><i>Gal.</i> Simpl. fac. lib. 3.</span>
were the food of many Nations: and <i>Hippocrates</i><span class="sidenote"><i>Hip.</i> de morbis de superfit.</span> ranketh the flesh of
Whelps with that of Birds: who also commends them against the Spleen,
and to promote conception. The opinion in <i>Galens</i> time, which
<i>Pliny</i> also followeth, deeply condemned
Horse-flesh, and conceived the very blood thereof destructive; but no
diet is more common among the <i>Tartars</i>, who also drink their blood. And
though this may only seem an adventure of <i>Northern</i> stomacks, yet as
<i>Herodotus</i> tells us, in the hotter clime of <i>Persia</i>, the same was a
convivial dish, and solemnly eaten at the feasts of their nativities:
whereat they dressed whole Horses, Camels and Asses; contemning the
Poverty of <i>Grecian</i> feasts, as unfurnish&rsquo;d of dishes sufficient to fill
the bellies of their guests.</p>

<p>Again, While we confine our diet in several places, all things almost
are eaten, if we take in the whole earth: for that which is refused in
one country, is accepted in another, and in the collective judgment of
the world, particular distinctions are overthrown. Thus were it not hard
to shew, that Tigers, Elephants, Camels, Mice, Bats and others, are the
food of several countries; and <i>Lerius</i> with others delivers, that some
<i>Americans</i> eat of all kinds, not refraining Toads and Serpents: and
some have run so high, as not to spare the flesh of man: a practise
inexcusable, nor to be drawn into example, a diet beyond the rule and
largest indulgence of God.</p>

<p>As for the objection against beasts and birds of prey, it acquitteth not
our practice, who observe not this distinction in fishes: nor regard the
same in our diet of Pikes, Perches and Eels; Nor are we excused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span> herein,
if we examine the stomacks of Mackerels, Cods, and Whitings. Nor is the
foulness of food sufficient to justifie our choice; for (beside that
their natural heat is able to convert the same into laudable aliment) we
refuse not many whose diet is more impure then some which we reject; as
may be considered in hogs, ducks, puets, and many more.</p>

<p>Thus we perceive the practice of diet doth hold no certain course, nor
solid rule of selection or confinement; Some in an indistinct voracity
eating almost any, others out of a timorous pre-opinion, refraining very
many. Wherein indeed necessity, reason and Physick, are the best
determinators. Surely many animals may be fed on, like many plants;
though not in alimental, yet medical considerations: Whereas having
raised Antipathies by prejudgement or education, we often nauseate
proper meats, and abhor that diet which disease or temper requireth.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A problem.</i> </div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p><p>Now whether it were not best to conform unto the simple diet of our
fore-fathers; whether pure and simple waters were not more healthfull
then fermented liquors; whether there be not an ample sufficiency
without all flesh, in the food of honey, oyl, and the several parts of
milk: in the variety of grains, pulses, and all sorts of fruits; since
either bread or beverage may be made almost of all? whether nations have
rightly confined unto several meats? or whether the common food of one
countrey be not more agreeable unto another? how indistinctly all
tempers apply unto the same, and how the diet of youth and old age is
confounded: were considerations much concerning health, and might
prolong our days, but must not this discourse.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI_PE_III" id="CHAPTER_XXVI_PE_III">CHAPTER XXVI</a>
<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of Sperma-Ceti, and the Sperma-Ceti Whale.</span></h2>


<p>What Sperma-Ceti is, men might justly doubt, since the learned
<i>Hofmannus</i> in his work of Thirty years<span class="sidenote">De medicamentis officin.</span>,
saith plainly, <i>Nescio quid sit</i>. And therefore need not wonder at the
variety of opinions; while some conceived it to be <i>flos maris</i>, and
many, a bituminous substance floating upon the sea.</p>

<p>That it was not the spawn of the Whale, according to vulgar conceit, or
nominal appellation Phylosophers have always doubted, not easily
conceiving the Seminal humour of Animals, should be inflamable; or of a
floating nature.</p>

<p>That it proceedeth from a Whale, beside the relation of <i>Clusius</i> and
other learned observers, was indubitably determined, not many years
since by a Sperma-Ceti Whale,  <span class="sidenote15"> <i>Near</i> Wells.</span>
cast on our coast of <i>Norfolk</i>. Which, to lead on further inquiry, we cannot omit to inform. It
contained no less then sixty foot in length, the head somewhat peculiar,
with a large prominency over the mouth; teeth only in the lower Jaw,
received into fleshly sockets in the upper. The Weight of the largest
about two pound: No gristly substances in the mouth, commonly called
Whale-bones; Only two short finns seated forwardly on the back; the eyes
but small, the pizell large, and prominent. <span class="sidenote"><i>Near</i>
Hunstanton.</span>A lesser Whale of this kind above twenty years ago, was
cast upon the same shore. </p>


<p>The discription of this Whale seems omitted by <i>Gesner</i>, <i>Rondeletius</i>,
and the first Editions of <i>Aldro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>vandus</i>; but describeth the latin
impression of <i>Pareus</i>, in the Exoticks of <i>Clusius</i>, and the natural
history of <i>Nirembergius</i>; but more amply in Icons and figures of
<i>Johnstonus</i>.</p>

<p>Mariners (who are not the best Nomenclators) called it a <i>Jubartas</i>, or
rather <i>Gibbartas</i>. Of the same appellation we meet with one in
<i>Rondeletius</i>, called by the <i>French</i> Gibbar, from its round and Gibbous
back. The name <i>Gibbarta</i> we find also given unto one kind of
<i>Greenland</i> Whales: But this of ours seemed not to answer the Whale of
that denomination; but was more agreeable unto the <i>Trumpa</i> or
Sperma-Ceti Whale: according to the account of our <i>Greenland</i>
describers in <i>Purchas</i>. And maketh the third among the eight remarkable
Whales of that Coast.</p>

<p>Out of the head of this Whale, having been dead divers days, and under
putrifaction, flowed streams of oyl and Sperma-Ceti; which was carefully
taken up and preserved by the Coasters. But upon breaking up, the
Magazin of Sperma-Ceti, was found in the head lying in folds and
courses, in the bigness of goose eggs, encompassed with large flakie
substances, as large as a mans head, in form of hony-combs, very white
and full of oyl.</p>

<p>Some resemblance or trace hereof there seems to be in the <i>Physiter</i> or
<i>Capidolio</i> of <i>Rondeletius</i>; while he delivers, that a fatness more
liquid then oyl, runs from the brain of that animal; which being out,
the Reliques are like the scales of <i>Sardinos</i> pressed into a mass;
which melting with heat, are again concreted by cold. And this many
conceive to have been the fish which swallowed <i>Jonas</i>. Although for the
largeness of the mouth, and frequency in those seas, it may possibly be
the <i>Lamia</i>.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>Some part of the Sperma-Ceti found on the shore was pure, and needed
little depuration; a great part mixed with fetid oyl, needing good
preparation, and frequent expression, to bring it to a flakie
consistency. And not only the head, but other parts contained it. For
the carnous parts being roasted, the oyl dropped out, an axungious and
thicker parts subsiding; the oyl it self contained also much in it, and
still after many years some is obtained from it.</p>

<p><i>Greenland</i> Enquirers seldom meet with a Whale of this kind: and
therefore it is but a contingent Commodity, not reparable from any
other. It flameth white and candent like Camphire, but dissolveth not in
<i>aqua fortis</i>, like it. Some lumps containing about two ounces, kept
ever since in water, afford a fresh and flosculous smell. Well prepared
and separated from the oyl, it is of a substance unlikely to decay, and
may out last the oyl required in the Composition of <i>Mathiolus</i>.</p>

<p>Of the large quantity of oyl, what first came forth by expression from
the Sperma-Ceti, grew very white and clear, like that of Almonds or Ben.
What came by decoction was red. It was found to spend much in the
vessels which contained it: It freezeth or coagulateth quickly with
cold, and the newer soonest. It seems different from the oyl of any
other animal, and very much frustrated the expectation of our
soap-boylers, as not incorporating or mingling with their lyes. But it
mixeth well with painting Colours, though hardly drieth at all. Combers
of wooll made use hereof, and Country people for cuts, aches and hard
tumors. It may prove of good Medical use; and serve for a ground in
compounded oyls and Balsams. Distilled, it affords a strong oyl, with a
quick and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span> piercing water. Upon Evaporation it gives a balsame, which is
better performed with Turpentine distilled with Sperma-Ceti.</p>

<p>Had the abominable scent permitted, enquiry had been made into that
strange composure of the head, and hillock of flesh about it. Since the
Work-men affirmed, they met with <i>Sperma-Ceti</i> before they came to the
bone, and the head yet preserved, seems to confirm the same. The
Sphincters inserving unto the Fistula or spout, might have been
examined, since they are so notably contrived in other cetaceous
Animals; as also the Larynx or Throtle, whether answerable unto that of
Dolphins and Porposes in the strange composure and figure which it
maketh. What figure the stomack maintained in this Animal of one jaw of
teeth, since in Porposes, which abound in both, the ventricle is trebly
divided, and since in that formerly taken nothing was found but Weeds
and a Loligo. The heart, lungs, and kidneys had not escaped; wherein are
remarkable differences from Animals of the land, likewise what humor the
bladder contained, but especially the seminal parts, which might have
determined the difference of that humour; from this which beareth its
name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p><p>In vain it was to rake for Ambergreece in the panch of this <i>Leviathan</i>,
as <i>Greenland</i> discoverers, and attests of experience dictate, that they
sometimes swallow great lumps thereof in the Sea; insufferable fetour
denying that enquiry. And yet if, as <i>Paracelsus</i> encourageth, Ordure
makes the best Musk, and from the most fetid substances may be drawn the
most odoriferous Essences; all that had not <i>Vespasians</i> Nose <span class="sidenote">Cui

other Animals, which examined, prove
either false or dubious.</p>


<p>1. And first from great Antiquity, and before the Melody of <i>Syrens</i>,
the Musical note of Swans hath been commended, and that they sing most
sweetly before their death. For thus we read in <i>Plato</i>, that from the
opinion of <i>Metempsuchosis</i>, or transmigration of the souls of men into
the bodies of beasts most sutable unto their humane condition, after his
death, <i>Orpheus</i> the Musician became a Swan. Thus was it the bird of
<i>Apollo</i> the god of Musick by the <i>Greeks</i>; and an Hieroglyphick of
musick among the <i>Egyptians</i>, from whom the <i>Greeks</i> derived the
conception; hath been the affirmation of many Latines, and hath not
wanted assertors almost from every Nation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Of swans, and their singing before death.</i></div>

<p>All which notwithstanding, we find this relation doubtfully received by
<i>√Ülian</i>, as an hear-say account by <i>Bellonius</i>, as a false one by
<i>Pliny</i>, expresly refuted by <i>Myndius</i> in <i>Athen√¶us</i>; and severely
rejected by <i>Scaliger</i>; whose words unto <i>Cardan</i> are these: <i>De Cygni
vero cantu suavissimo quem cum parente mendaciorum Gr√¶cia jactare ausus
est, ad Luciani tribunal, apud quem novi aliquid dicas, statuo.</i> Authors
also that countenance it, speak not satisfactorily of it. Some affirming
they sing not till they die; some that they sing, yet die not. Some
speak generally, as though this note were in all; some but particularly,
as though it were only in some; some in places remote, and where we can
have no trial of it; others in places where every experience can refute
it; as <i>Aldrovandus</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span> upon relation delivered, concerning the Musick of
the Swans on the river of <i>Thames</i> near <i>London</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The figuration to be found in Elks, and not in common
Swans.</i></div>

<p>Now that which countenanceth, and probably confirmeth this opinion, is
the strange and unusual conformation of the wind pipe, or vocal organ in
this animal; observed first by <i>Aldrovandus</i>, and conceived by some
contrived for this intention. For in its length it far exceedeth the
gullet; and hath in the chest a sinuous revolution, that is, when it
ariseth from the lungs, it ascendeth not directly unto the throat, but
descending first into a capsulary reception of the breast bone; by a
Serpentine and Trumpet recurvation it ascendeth again into the neck; and
so by the length thereof a great quantity of air is received, and by the
figure thereof a Musical modulation effected. But to speak
indifferently, this formation of the Weazon, is not peculiar unto the
Swan, but common also unto the Platea or Shovelard, a bird of no Musical
throat; And as <i>Aldrovandus</i> confesseth, may thus be contrived in the
Swan to contain a larger stock of air, whereby being to feed on weeds at
the bottom, they might the longer space detain their heads under water.
But were this formation peculiar, or had they unto this effect an
advantage from this part: yet have they a known and open disadvantage
from another; that is, a flat bill. For no Latirostrous animal (whereof
nevertheless there are no slender numbers) were ever commended for there
note, or accounted among those animals which have been instructed to
speak.</p>

<p>When therefore we consider the dissention of Authors, the falsity of
relations, the indisposition of the Organs, and the immusical note of
all we ever beheld or heard of; if generally taken and comprehending all
Swans, or of all places, we cannot assent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span> thereto. Surely he that is
bit with a Tarantula, shall never be cured by this Musick; and with the
same hopes we expect to hear the harmony of the Spheres.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Of the Peacock.</i></div>

<p>2. That there is a special propriety in the flesh of Peacocks, roast or
boiled, to preserve a long time incorrupted, hath been the assertion of
many; stands yet confirmed by <i>Austin</i>, <i>De Civitate Dei</i>; by <i>Gygas
Sempronius</i>, in <i>Aldrovandus</i>; and the same experiment we can confirm
our selves, in the brawn or fleshly parts of Peacoks so hanged up with
thred, that they touch no place whereby to contract a moisture; and
hereof we have made trial both in summer and winter. The reason, some, I
perceive, attempt to make out from the siccity and driness of its flesh,
and some are content to rest in a secret propriety thereof. As for the
siccity of the flesh, it is more remarkable in other animals, as Eagles,
Hawks, and birds of prey; That it is a propriety or agreeable unto none
other, we cannot with reason admit: for the same preservation, or rather
incorruption we have observed in the flesh of Turkeys, Capons, Hares,
Partridge, Venison, suspended freely in the air, and after a year and a
half, dogs have not refused to eat them.</p>

<p>As for the other conceit, that a Peacok is ashamed when he looks on his
legs, as is commonly held, and also delivered by <i>Cardan</i>; beside what
hath been said against it by <i>Scaliger</i>; let them believe that hold
specificial deformities; or that any part can seem unhandsome to their
eyes, which hath appeared good and beautiful unto their makers. The
occasion of this conceit, might first arise from a common observation,
that when they are in their pride, that is, advance their train, if they
decline their neck to the ground, they presently demit, and let fall the
same: which indeed they cannot otherwise do; for contracting their
body,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span> and being forced to draw in their foreparts to establish the
hinder in the elevation of the train; if the foreparts depart and
incline to the ground, the hinder grow too weak, and suffer the train to
fall. And the same in some degree is also observable in Turkeys.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Of the Stork.</i></div>

<p>3. That Storks are to be found, and will only live in Republikes or free
States, is a petty conceit to advance the opinion of popular policies,
and from Antipathies in nature, to disparage Monarchical government. But
how far agreeable unto truth, let them consider who read in <i>Pliny</i>,
that among the <i>Thessalians</i> who were governed by Kings, and much
abounded with Serpents, it was no less then capital to kill a Stork.
That the Ancient <i>Egyptians</i> honoured them, whose government was from
all times Monarchical. That <i>Bellonius</i> affirmeth, men make them nests
in <i>France</i>. That relations make them common in <i>Persia</i>, and the
dominions of the great <i>Turk</i>. And lastly, how <i>Jeremy</i> the Prophet
delivered himself<span class="sidenote10">Ier. 8. 7.</span> unto his countreymen, whose
government was at that time Monarchical. The Stork in the heaven knowing
her appointed time, the Turtle, Crane and Swallow observe the time of
their coming, but my people know not the judgment of the Lord. Wherein
to exprobate their stupidity, he induceth the providence of Storks. Now
if the bird had been unknown, the illustration had been obscure, and the
exprobation not so proper.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Of the Bittor.</i></div>

<p>4. That a Bittor maketh that mugient noise, or as we term it Bumping, by
putting its bill into a reed as most believe, or as <i>Bellonius</i> and
<i>Aldrovandus</i> conceive, by putting the same in water or mud, and after a
while retaining the air by suddenly excluding it again, is not so easily
made out. For my own part, though after diligent enquiry, I could never
behold them in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span> motion; Notwithstanding by others whose
observations we have expressly requested, we are informed, that some
have beheld them making this noise on the shore, their bills being far
enough removed from reed or water; that is, first strongly attracting
the air, and unto a manifest distention of the neck, and presently after
with great contention and violence excluding the same again. As for what
others affirm of putting their bill in water or mud, it is also hard to
make out. For what may be observed from any that walketh the Fens, there
is little intermission, nor any observable pawse, between the drawing in
and sending forth of their breath. And the expiration or breathing forth
doth not only produce a noise, but the inspiration or hailing in of the
air, affordeth a sound that may be heard almost a flight-shot.</p>

<p>Now the reason of this strange and peculiar noise, is deduced from the
conformation of the wind-pipe, which in this bird is different from
other volatiles. For at the upper extream it hath no fit Larinx, or
throttle to qualify the sound, and at the other end, by two branches
deriveth it self into the lungs. Which division consisteth only of
Semicircular fibers, and such as attain but half way round the part; By
which formation they are dilatable into larger capacities, and are able
to contain a fuller proportion of air; which being with violence sent up
the weazon, and finding no resistance by the Larinx, it issueth forth in
a sound like that from caverns, and such as sometimes subterraneous
eruptions, from hollow rocks afford. As <i>Aristotle</i> observeth in a
Problem<span class="sidenote10"><i>Sect. 15.</i></span>, and is observable in pitchers, bottles, and
that instrument which <i>Aponensis</i> upon that Problem describeth,
wherewith in <i>Aristotles</i> time Gardiners affrighted birds.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>Whether the large perforations of the extremities of the weazon, in the
<i>abdomen</i>, admitting large quantity of ayr within the cavity of its
membrans, as it doth in Frogs; may not much assist this mugiency or
boation, may also be considered. For such as have beheld them making
this noise out of the water, observe a large distention in their bodies;
and their ordinary note is but like that of a Raven.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Of Whelps.</i></div>

<p>5. That whelps are blind nine days and then begin to see, is the common
opinion of all, and some will be apt enough to descend unto oaths upon
it. But this I find not answerable unto experience, for upon a strict
observation of many, I have scarce found any that see the ninth day, few
before the twelfth, and the eyes of some not open before the fourteenth
day. And this is agreeable unto the determination of <i>Aristotle</i>: who
computeth the time of their anopsie or non-vision by that of their
gestation. For some, saith he, do go with their young the sixt part of a
year, two days over or under, that is, about sixty days or nine weeks;
and the whelps of these see not till twelve days. Some go the fifth part
of a year, that is, seventy-one days, and these, saith he, see not
before the fourteenth day. Others do go the fourth part of the year,
that is, three whole months, and these, saith he, are without sight no
less then seventeen days. Wherein although the accounts be different,
yet doth the least thereof exceed the term of nine days, which is so
generally received. And this compute of <i>Aristotle</i> doth generally
overthrow the common cause alleadged for this effect, that is, a
precipitation or over-hasty exclusion before the birth be perfect,
according unto the vulgar Adage, <i>Festinans canis c√¶cos parit catulos</i>:
for herein the whelps of longest gestation, are also the latest in
vision. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span> manner hereof is this. At the first littering, their eyes
are fastly closed, that is, by coalition or joining together of the
eyelids, and so continue untill about the twelfth day; at which time
they begin to separate, and may be easily divelled or parted asunder;
they open at the inward Canthis or greater Angle of the eye, and so by
degrees dilate themselves quite open. An effect very strange, and the
cause of much obscurity, wherein as yet mens enquiries are blind, and
satisfaction not easily acquirable. What ever it be, thus much may we
observe, those animals are only excluded without sight, which are
multiparous and multifidous, that is, which have many at a litter, and
have also their feet divided into many portions. For the Swine, although
multiparous, yet being bisulcous, and only cloven hoofed, is not
excluded in this manner, but farrowed with open eyes, as other bisulcous
animals.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Of a Toad and a Spider.</i></div>

<p>6. The Antipathy between a Toad and a Spider, and that they poisonously
destroy each other, is very famous, and solemn stories have been written
of their combats; wherein most commonly the victory is given unto the
Spider. Of what Toads and Spiders it is to be understood would be
considered. For the Phalangium and deadly Spiders, are different from
those we generally behold in <i>England</i>. However the verity hereof, as
also of many others, we cannot but desire; for hereby we might be surely
provided of proper Antidotes in cases which require them; But what we
have observed herein, we cannot in reason conceal; who having in a Glass
included a Toad with several Spiders, we beheld the Spiders without
resistance to sit upon his head and pass over all his body; which at
last upon advantage he swallowed down, and that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span> few hours, unto the
number of seven. And in the like manner will Toads also serve Bees, and
are accounted enemies unto their Hives.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Of a Lion and a Cock.</i></div>

<p>7. Whether a Lion be also afraid of a Cock, as is related by many, and
believed by most, were very easie in some places to make trial. Although
how far they stand in fear of that animal, we may sufficiently
understand, from what is delivered by <i>Camerarius</i>, whose words in his
Symbola are these: <i>Nostris temporibus in Aula serenissimi Principis
Bavari√¶, unus ex Leonibus miris saltibus in vicinam cujusdam domus aream
sese dimisit, ubi Gallinaceorum cantum aut clamores nihil reformidans,
ipsos un√† cum plurimis gallinis devoravit.</i> That is, In our time in the
Court of the Prince of <i>Bavaria</i>, one of the Lions leaped down into a
Neighbours yard, where nothing regarding the crowing or noise of the
Cocks, he eat them up with many other Hens. And therefore a very unsafe
defensative it is against the fury of this animal (and surely no better
then Virginity or bloud Royal) which <i>Pliny</i><span class="sidenote">De sacrificiis et
magia.</span> doth place in Cock broth: For herewith, saith he, whoever is
anointed (especially if Garlick be boiled therein) no Lion or Panther
will touch him. But of an higher nature it were, and more exalted
Antipathy, if that were certain which <i>Proclus</i> delivers, that solary
<i>D√¶mons</i>, and such as appear in the shape of Lions, will disappear and
vanish, if a Cock be presented upon them.</p>

<p>8. It is generally conceived, an Ear-wig hath no Wings, and is reckoned
amongst impennous insects by many; but he that shall narrowly observe
them, or shall with a needle put aside the short and sheathy cases on
their back, may extend and draw forth two wings of a proportionable
length for flight, and larger then in many flies. The experiment of
<i>Pennius</i> is yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span> more perfect, who with a Rush or Bristle so pricked
them as to make them flie.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Of Worms.</i></div>

<p>9. That Worms are exanguious Animals, and such as have no bloud at all,
is the determination of Philosophy, the general opinion of Scholars, and
I know not well to dissent from thence my self. If so, surely we want a
proper term whereby to express that humour in them which so strictly
resembleth bloud: and we refer it unto the discernment of others what to
determine of that red and sanguineous humor, found more plentifully
about the Torquis or carneous Circle of great Worms in the Spring,
affording in Linnen or Paper an indiscernable tincture from bloud. Or
wherein that differeth from a vein, which in an apparent blew runneth
along the body, and if dexterously pricked with a lancet, emitteth a red
drop, which pricked on either side it will not readily afford.</p>

<p>In the upper parts of Worms, there are likewise found certain white and
oval Glandulosities, which Authors term Eggs, and in magnifying Glasses,
they also represent them; how properly, may also be enquired; since if
in them there be distinction of Sexes, these Eggs are to be found in
both. For in that which is presumed to be their coition, that is, their
usual complication, or lateral adhesion above the ground, dividing
suddenly with two Knives the adhering parts of both, I have found these
Eggs in either.</p>

<p>10. That Flies, Bees, etc. do make that noise or humming sound by their
mouth, or as many believe with their wings only, would be more warily
asserted, if we consulted the determination of <i>Aristotle</i>, who as in
sundry other places, so more expresly in his book of respiration,
affirmeth this sound to be made by the illision of an inward spirit upon
a pellicle or little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span> membrane about the precinct or pectoral division
of their body. If we also consider that a Bee or Flie, so it be able to
move the body, will buz, though its head be off; that it will do the
like if deprived of wings, reserving the head, whereby the body may be
the better moved. And that some also which are big and lively will hum
without either head or wing.</p>

<p>Nor is it only the beating upon this little membrane, by the inward and
con-natural spirit as <i>Aristotle</i> determines, or the outward air as
<i>Scaliger</i> conceiveth, which affordeth this humming noise, but most of
the other parts may also concur hereto; as will be manifest, if while
they hum we lay our finger on the back or other parts; for thereupon
will be felt a serrous or jarring motion like that which happeneth while
we blow on the teeth of a comb through paper; and so if the head or
other parts of the trunk be touched with oyl, the sound will be much
impaired, if not destroyed: for those being also dry and membranous
parts, by attrition of the spirit do help to advance the noise: And
therefore also the sound is strongest in dry weather, and very weak in
rainy season, and toward winter; for then the air is moist, and the
inward spirit growing weak, makes a languid and dumb allision upon the
parts.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Of a Tainct.</i></div>

<p>11. There is found in the Summer a kind of Spider called a Tainct, of a
red colour, and so little of body that ten of the largest will hardly
outway a grain; this by Country people is accounted a deadly poison unto
Cows and Horses; who, if they suddenly die, and swell thereon, ascribe
their death hereto, and will commonly say, they have licked a Tainct.
Now to satisfie the doubts of men we have called this tradition unto
experiment; we have given hereof unto Dogs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span> Chickens, Calves and
Horses, and not in the singular number; yet never could find the least
disturbance ensue. There must be therefore other causes enquired of the
sudden death and swelling of cattle; and perhaps this insect is
mistaken, and unjustly accused for some other. For some there are which
from elder times have been observed pernicious unto cattle, as the
Buprestis or Burstcow, the Pityocampe or Eruca Pinuum, by <i>Dioscorides,
Galen</i> and <i>√Ütius</i>, the Staphilinus described by <i>Aristotle</i> and others,
or those red Phalangious Spiders like Cantharides mentioned by
<i>Muffetas</i>. Now although the animal may be mistaken and the opinion also
false, yet in the ground and reason which makes men most to doubt the
verity hereof, there may be truth enough, that is, the inconsiderable
quantity of this insect. For that a poison cannot destroy in so small a
bulk, we have no reason to affirm. For if, as <i>Leo Africanus</i> reporteth,
the tenth part of a grain of the poison of <i>Nubia</i><span class="sidenote15">granum Nubi√¶.</span>,
will dispatch a man in two hours; if the bite of a Viper and sting of a
Scorpion, is not conceived to impart so much; if the bite of an Asp will
kill within an hour, yet the impression scarce visible, and the poison
communicated not ponderable; we cannot as impossible reject this way of
destruction; or deny the power of death in so narrow a circumscription.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Of the Glow-worm</i>.</div>

<p>12. Wondrous things are promised from the Glow-worm; from thence
perpetual lights are pretended, and waters said to be distilled which
afford a lustre in the night; and this is asserted by <i>Cardan, Albertus,
Gaudentinus, Mizaldus</i>, and many more. But hereto we cannot with reason
assent: for the light made by this animal depends much upon its life.
For when they are dead they shine not, nor alwaies while they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span> live; but
are obscure or light, according to the protrusion of their luminous
parts, as observation will instruct us. For this flammeous light is not
over all the body, but only visible on the inward side; in a small white
part near the tail. When this is full and seemeth protruded, there
ariseth a flame of a circular figure and Emerald green colour; which is
discernable in any dark place in the day; but when it falleth and
seemeth contracted, the light disappeareth, and the colour of the part
only remaineth. Now this light, as it appeareth and disappeareth in
their life, so doth it go quite out at their death. As we have observed
in some, which preserved in fresh grass have lived and shined eighteen
days; but as they declined, and the luminous humor dryed, their light
grew languid, and at last went out with their lives. Thus also the
<i>Torpedo</i>, which alive hath a power to stupifie at a distance, hath none
upon contaction being dead, as <i>Galen</i> and <i>Rondeletius</i> particularly
experimented. And this hath also disappointed the mischief of those
intentions, which study the advancement of poisons; and fancy
destructive compositions from Asps or Vipers teeth, from Scorpions or
Hornet stings. For these omit their efficacy in the death of the
individual, and act but dependantly on their forms. And thus far also
those Philosophers concur with us, which held the Sun and Stars were
living creatures, for they conceived their lustre depended on their
lives; but if they ever died, their light must also perish.</p>

<p>It were a Notable piece of Art to translate the light from the
<i>Bononian</i> Stone into another Body; he that would attempt to make a
shining Water from <i>Glow-worms</i>, must make trial when the Splendent part
is fresh and turgid. For even from the great <i>American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span> Glow-worms</i>, and
Flaming <i>Flies</i>, the light declineth as the luminous humor dryeth.</p>

<p>Now whether the light of animals, which do not occasionally shine from
contingent causes, be of Kin unto the light of Heaven; whether the
invisible flame of life received in a convenient matter, may not become
visible, and the diffused √¶therial light make little Stars by
conglobation in idoneous parts of the compositum: whether also it may
not have some original in the seed and spirit analogous unto the Element
of Stars, whereof some glympse is observable in the little refulgent
humor, at the first attempts of formation: Philosophy may yet enquire.</p>

<p>True it is, that a Glow-worm will afford a faint light, almost a days
space when many will conceive it dead; but this is a mistake in the
compute of death, and term of disanimation; for indeed, it is not then
dead, but if it be distended will slowly contract it self again, which
when it cannot do, it ceaseth to shine any more. And to speak strictly,
it is no easie matter to determine the point of death in Insects and
Creatures who have not their vitalities radically confined unto one
part; for they are not dead when they cease to move or afford the
visible evidences of life; as may be observed in Flies, who when they
appear even desperate and quite forsaken of their forms; by vertue of
the Sun or warm ashes will be revoked unto life, and perform its
functions again.</p>

<p>Now whether this lustre, a while remaining after death, dependeth not
still upon the first impression, and light communicated or raised from
an inward spirit, subsisting a while in a moist and apt recipient, nor
long continuing in this, or the more remarkable <i>Indian</i> Glow-worm; or
whether it be of another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span> Nature, and proceedeth from different causes
of illumination; yet since it confessedly subsisteth so little a while
after their lives, how to make perpetual lights, and sublunary moons
thereof as is pretended, we rationally doubt, though not so sharply
deny, with <i>Scaliger</i> and <i>Muffetus</i>.</p>

<p>13. The wisdom of the Pismire is magnified by all, and in the
Panegyricks of their providence we alwaies meet with this, that to
prevent the growth of Corn which they store up, they bite off the end
thereof: And some have conceived that from hence they have their name in
Hebrew: <span class="sidenote">Nemalah √† Namal circumcidit.</span> From whence ariseth a conceit
that Corn will not grow if the extreams be cut or broken. But herein we
find no security to prevent its germination; as having made trial in
grains, whose ends cut off have notwithstanding suddenly sprouted, and
accordingly to the Law of their kinds; that is, the roots of barley and
oats at contrary ends, of wheat and rye at the same. And therefore some
have delivered that after rainy weather they dry these grains in the
Sun; which if effectual, we must conceive to be made in a high degree
and above the progression of Malt; for that Malt will grow, this year
hath informed us, and that unto a perfect ear.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A natural vicissitude of generation in Homogeneous things.</i></div>

<p>And if that be true which is delivered by many, and we shall further
experiment, that a decoction of Toad-stools if poured upon earth, will
produce the same again: If Sow-thistles will abound in places manured
with dung of Hogs, which feeds much upon that plant: If Horse-dung
reproduceth oats: If winds and rains will transport the seminals of
plants; it will not be easie to determine where the power of generation
ceaseth. The forms of things may lie deeper then we conceive them;
seminal principles may not be dead in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span> the divided atoms of plants: but
wandering in the ocean of nature, when they hit upon proportionable
materials, may unite, and return to their visible selves again.</p>

<p>But the prudence of this Animal is by knawing, piercing, or otherwise,
to destroy the little nebbe or principle of germination. Which
notwithstanding is not easily discoverable; it being no ready business
to meet with such grains in Ant-hils; and he must dig deep, that will
seek them in the Winter.</p>

<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of some others.</span></h2>


<div class="sidenote"><i>Of the Chicken.</i></div>

<p>That a Chicken is formed out of the yelk of the Egg, was the opinion of
some Ancient Philosophers. Whether it be not the nutriment of the
Pullet, may also be considered: Since umbilical vessels are carried unto
it: Since much of the yelk remaineth after the Chicken is formed: Since
in a Chicken newly hatched, the stomack is tincted yellow, and the belly
full of yelk, which is drawn in at the navel or vessels towards the
vent, as may be discerned in Chickens within a day or two before
exclusion.</p>

<p>Whether the Chicken be made out of the white, or that be not also its
aliment, is likewise very questionable: Since an umbilical vessel is
derived unto it: Since after the formation and perfect shape of the
Chicken, much of the white remaineth.</p>

<p>Whether it be not made out of the grando, gallature, germ or tred of the
Egg, as, <i>Aquapendente</i> informeth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span> us, seemed to many of doubt: for at
the blunter end it is not discovered after the Chicken is formed; by
this also the yelk and white are continued, whereby it may conveniently
receive its nutriment from them both.</p>

<p>Now that from such slender materials, nature should effect this
production it is no more then is observed in other animals; and even in
grains and kernels, the greatest part is but the nutriment of that
generative particle, so disproportionable unto it.</p>

<div class="sidenote10"><i>Of Eggs.</i></div>

<p>A greater difficulty in the doctrine of Eggs, is, how the sperm of the
Cock prolificates and makes the oval conception fruitful, or how it
attaineth unto every Egg, since the vitellary or place of the yelk is
very high: Since the ovary or part where the white involveth it, is in
the second region of the matrix, which is somewhat long and inverted:
Since also a Cock will in one day fertilate the whole racemation or
cluster of Eggs, which are not excluded in many weeks after.</p>

<p>But these at last, and how in the Cicatricula or little pale circle
formation first beginneth, how the Grando or tredle, are but the poles
and establishing particles of the tender membrans, firmly conserving the
floating parts, in their proper places, with many other observables,
that ocular Philosopher, and singular discloser of truth, Dr. <i>Harvey</i>
hath discovered, in that excellent discourse of Generation; So strongly
erected upon the two great pillars of truth, experience and solid
reason.</p>

<p>That the sex is discernable from the figure of Eggs, or that Cocks or
Hens proceed from long or round ones, as many contend, experiment will
easily frustrate.</p>

<p>The <i>√Ügyptians</i> observed a better way to hatch their Eggs in Ovens, then
the <i>Babylonians</i> to roast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span> them at the bottom of a sling, by swinging
them round about, till heat from motion had concocted them; for that
confuseth all parts without any such effect.</p>

<p>Though slight distinction be made between boiled and roasted Eggs, yet
is there no slender difference, for the one is much drier then the
other: the Egg expiring less in the elixation or boiling; whereas in the
assation or roasting, it will sometimes abate a dragm; that is,
threescore grains in weight. So a new laid Egg will not so easily be
boiled hard, because it contains a greater stock of humid parts; which
must be evaporated, before the heat can bring the inexhalable parts into
consistence.</p>

<p>Why the Hen hatcheth not the Egg in her belly, or maketh not at least
some rudiment thereof within her self, by the natural heat of inward
parts, since the same is performed by incubation from an outward warmth
after? Why the Egg is thinner at one extream? Why there is some cavity
or emptiness at the blunter end? Why we open them at that part? Why the
greater end is first excluded? Why some Eggs are all red, as the
Kestrils; some only red at one end, as those of Kites and Buzzards? why
some Eggs are not Oval but Round, as those of fishes? etc. are problems,
whose decisions would too much enlarge this discourse.</p>

<div class="sidenote15"><i>Of Snakes, etc.</i></div>

<p>That Snakes and Vipers do sting or transmit their mischief by the tail,
is a common expression not easily to be justified; and a determination
of their venoms unto a part, wherein we could never find it; the poison
lying about the teeth, and communicated by bite, in such are
destructive. And therefore when biting Serpents are mentioned in the
Scripture, they are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span> differentially set down from such as mischief
by stings; nor can conclusions be made conformable to this opinion,
because when the Rod of <i>Moses</i> was turned into a Serpent, God
determinately commanded him to take up the same by the tail.</p>

<p>Nor are all Snakes of such empoisoning qualities, as common opinion
presumeth; as is confirmable from the ordinary green Snake with us, from
several histories of domestick Snakes, from Ophiophagous nations, and
such as feed upon Serpents.</p>

<p>Surely the destructive delusion of Satan in this shape, hath much
enlarged the opinion of their mischief. Which notwithstanding was not so
high with the heathens, in whom the Devil had wrought a better opinion
of this animal, it being sacred unto the <i>Egyptians</i>, <i>Greeks</i> and
<i>Romans</i>, and the common symbole of sanity. In the shape whereof
<i>√Üsculapius</i> the God of health appeared unto the <i>Romans</i>, accompanied
their Embassadors to <i>Rome</i> from <i>Epidaurus</i>; and the same did stand in
the <i>Tiberine</i> Isle upon the Temple of <i>√Üsculapius</i>.</p>

<p>Some doubt many have of the Tarantula, or poisonous Spider of
<i>Calabria</i>, and that magical cure of the bite thereof by Musick. But
since we observe that many attest it from experience: Since the learned
<i>Kircherius</i> hath positively averred it, and set down the songs and
tunes solemnly used for it; Since some also affirm the Tarantula it self
will dance upon certain stroaks, whereby they set their instruments
against its poison; we shall not at all question it.</p>

<p>Much wonder is made of the Boramez, that strange plant-animal or
vegetable Lamb of <i>Tartary</i>, which Wolves delight to feed on, which hath
the shape of a Lamb, affordeth a bloody juyce upon breaking, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span> liveth
while the plants be consumed about it. And yet if all this be no more,
then the shape of a Lamb in the flower or seed, upon the top of the
stalk, as we meet with the forms of Bees, Flies and Dogs in some others;
he hath seen nothing that shall much wonder at it.</p>

<p>It may seem too hard to question the swiftness of Tigers, which hath
therefore given names unto Horses, Ships and Rivers, nor can we deny
what all have thus affirmed; yet cannot but observe, that <i>Jacobus
Bontius</i> late Physitian at <i>Java</i> in the East <i>Indies</i>, as an ocular and
frequent witness is not afraid to deny it; to condemn <i>Pliny</i> who
affirmeth it, and that indeed it is but a slow and tardigradous animal,
preying upon advantage, and otherwise may be escaped.</p>

<p>Many more there are whose serious enquiries we must request of others,
and shall only awake considerations, Whether that common opinion that
Snakes do breed out of the back or spinal marrow of man, doth build upon
any constant root or seed in nature; or did not arise from contingent
generation, in some single bodies remembred by <i>Pliny</i> or others, and
might be paralleld since in living corruptions of the guts and other
parts; which regularly proceed not to putrifactions of that nature.</p>

<p>Whether the Story of the Remora be not unreasonably amplified; whether
that of Bernacles and Goose-trees be not too much enlarged; whether the
common history of Bees will hold, as large accounts have delivered;
whether the brains of Cats be attended with such destructive
malignities, as <i>Dioscorides</i> and others put upon them.</p>

<p>As also whether there be not some additional help of Art, unto the
Numismatical and Musical shells,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span> which we sometimes meet with in
conchylious collections among us?</p>

<p>Whether the fasting spittle of man be poison unto Snakes and Vipers, as
experience hath made us doubt? Whether the Nightingals setting with her
breast against a thorn, be any more then that she placeth some prickels
on the outside of her nest, or roosteth in thorny and prickly places,
where Serpents may least approach her? Whether Mice may be bred by
putrifaction as well as univocall production, as may be easily believed,
if that receit to make Mice out of wheat will hold, which <i>Helmont</i> hath
delivered.<span class="sidenote15">Helm. Imago fermenti, <i>etc.</i></span> Whether Quails from any
idiosyncracy or peculiarity of constitution, do innocuously feed upon
Hellebore, or rather sometime but medically use the same; because we
perceive that Stares, which are commonly said harmlessly to feed on
Hemlock, do not make good the tradition; and he that observes what
vertigoes, cramps and convulsions follow thereon in these animals, will
be of our belief.</p>

<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of the Erectness of Man.</span></h2>

<div class="sidenote"><i>What figure in animals is properly erect.</i></div>

<p>That only <i>Man</i> hath an Erect figure, and for to behold and look up
toward heaven, according to that of the Poet,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="line"><i>Pronaque cum spectant animalia c√¶tera terram,</i></div>
<div class="line"><i>Os homini sublime dedit, c√¶lumque tueri</i></div>
<div class="line"><i>Jussit, et erectos ad sydera tollere vultus,</i></div>
</div></div>

<p>is a double assertion, whose first part may be true, if we take
Erectness strictly, and so as <i>Galen</i> hath defined it; for they only,
saith he, have an Erect figure, whose spine and thigh-bone are carried
in right lines; and so indeed of any we yet know, <i>Man</i> only is Erect.
For the thighs of other animals do stand at Angles with their spine, and
have rectangular positions in Birds, and perfect Quadrupeds. Nor doth
the Frog, though stretched out, or swimming, attain the rectitude of
<i>Man</i>, or carry its thigh without all angularity. <span class="sidenote15"><i>What seiante or
sitting.</i></span> And thus is it also true, that Man only sitteth, if we
define<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span> sitting to be a firmation of the body upon the <i>Ischias</i>:
wherein if the position be just and natural, the Thigh-bone lieth at
right angles to the Spine, and the Leg-bone or Tibia to the Thigh. For
others when they seem to sit, as <i>Dogs</i>, <i>Cats</i>, or <i>Lions</i>, do make
unto their Spine acute angles with their Thigh, and acute to the Thigh
with their Shank. Thus is it likewise true, what <i>Aristotle</i> alledgeth
in that Problem; why <i>Man</i> alone suffereth pollutions in the Night,
<span class="sidenote15">·ºêŒæŒøŒΩŒµŒπœÅœâŒ∫œÑŒπŒ∫œåœÇ.</span> because <i>Man</i> only lyeth upon his Back; if we define
not the same by every supine position, but when the Spine is in
rectitude with the Thigh, and both with the arms lie parallel to the
<i>Horizon</i>: so that a line through their Navel will pass through the
Zenith and Centre of the Earth. And so cannot other Animals lie upon
their Backs: for though the Spine lie parallel with the <i>Horizon</i>, yet
will their Legs incline, and lie at angles unto it. And upon these three
divers positions in <i>Man</i>, wherein the Spine can only be at right lines
with the Thigh, arise those remarkable postures, prone, supine and
erect; which are but differenced in situation, or in angular postures
upon the Back, the Belly and the Feet.</p>

<p>But if Erectness be popularly taken, and as it is largely opposed unto
proneness, or the posture of animals looking downwards, carrying their
venters or opposite part to the Spine, directly towards the Earth, it
may admit of question. For though in <i>Serpents</i> and <i>Lizards</i> we may
truly allow a proneness, yet <i>Galen</i> acknowledgeth that perfect
Quadrupeds, as <i>Horses</i>, <i>Oxen</i> and <i>Camels</i>, are but partly prone, and
have some part of Erectness. And <i>Birds</i> or flying Animals, are so far
from this kind of proneness, that they are almost Erect; advancing the
Head and Breast in their pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>gression, and only prone in the Act of
volitation or flying. And if that be true which is delivered of the
<i>Pengin</i> or <i>Anser Magellanicus</i>, often described in Maps about those
<i>Straits</i>, that they go Erect like <i>Men</i>, and with their Breast and
Belly do make one line perpendicular unto the axis of the Earth; it will
almost make up the exact Erectness of <i>Man</i>. <span class="sidenote"><i>Observe also the</i>
Vrias Bellanii <i>and</i> Mergus major.</span> Nor will that Insect come very
short which we have often beheld, that is, one kind of Locust which
stands not prone, or a little inclining upward, but in a large
Erectness, elevating alwaies the two fore Legs, and sustaining it self
in the middle of the other four: by <i>Zoographers</i> <span class="sidenote"><i>Describers of
animals.</i></span> called <i>Mantis</i>, and by the common people of <i>Provence</i>,
<i>Prega</i>, <i>Dio</i>, the Prophet and praying Locust; as being generally found
in the posture of supplication, or such as resembleth ours, when we lift
up our hands to Heaven.</p>

<p>As for the end of this Erection; to look up toward Heaven; though
confirmed by several testimonies, and the <i>Greek</i> Etymology of <i>Man</i>, it
is not so readily to be admitted; and as a popular and vain conceit was
Anciently rejected by <i>Galen</i>; who in his third, <i>De usu partium</i>,
determines, that <i>Man</i> is Erect, because he was made with hands, and was
therewith to exercise all Arts, which in any other figure he could not
have performed; as he excellently declareth in that place, where he also
proves that <i>Man</i> could have been made neither Quadruped nor Centaur.</p>

<p>And for the accomplishment of this intention, that is, to look up and
behold the Heavens, <i>Man</i> hath a notable disadvantage in the Eye lid;
whereof the upper is far greater than the lower, which abridgeth the
sight upwards; contrary to those of <i>Birds</i>, who herein have the
advantage of <i>Man</i>: Insomuch that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span> Learned <i>Plempius</i><span class="sidenote">Plemp.
Ophthalmographia.</span> is bold to affirm, that if he had had the formation
of the Eye-lids, he would have contrived them quite otherwise.</p>

<p>The ground and occasion of this conceit was a literal apprehension of a
figurative expression in <i>Plato</i>, as <i>Galen</i> thus delivers; To opinion
that <i>Man</i> is Erect to look up and behold the Heavens, is a conceit only
fit for those that never saw the <i>Fish</i> Uranoscopus, that is, the
Beholder of Heaven; which hath its Eyes so placed, that it looks up
directly to Heaven; which <i>Man</i> doth not, except he recline, or bend his
head backward: and thus to look up to Heaven, agreeth not only unto
<i>Men</i>, but <i>Asses</i>; to omit <i>Birds</i> with long necks, which look not only
upwards, but round about at pleasure. And therefore <i>Men</i> of this
opinion understood not <i>Plato</i> when he said that <i>Man</i> doth <i>Sursum
aspicere</i>; for thereby was not meant to gape, or look upward with the
Eye, but to have his thoughts sublime; and not only to behold, but
speculate their Nature, with the Eye of the understanding.</p>

<p>Now although <i>Galen</i> in this place makes instance but in one, yet are
the other fishes, whose Eyes regard the Heavens, as Plane, and
Cartilagineous <i>Fishes</i>; as <i>Pectinals</i>, or such as have their bones
made laterally like a Comb; for when they apply themselves to sleep or
rest upon the white side, their Eyes on the other side look upward
toward Heaven. For <i>Birds</i>, they generally carry their heads Erectly
like <i>Man</i>, and have advantage in their upper Eye-lid; and many that
have long necks, and bear their heads somewhat backward, behold far more
of the Heavens, and seem to look above the √¶quinoxial Circle. And so
also in many Quadrupeds, although their progression be partly prone, yet
is the sight of their Eye direct, not respecting the Earth but Heaven;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
and make an higher Arch of altitude then our own. The position of a
<i>Frog</i> with his head above water exceedeth these; for therein he seems
to behold a large part of the Heavens, and the acies of his Eye to
ascend as high as the Tropick; but he that hath beheld the posture of a
<i>Bittor</i>, will not deny that it beholds almost the very <i>Zenith</i>. <span class="sidenote"><i>Point of heaven over our heads.</i></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II_PE_IV" id="CHAPTER_II_PE_IV">CHAPTER II</a>
<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of the Heart.</span></h2>


<div class="sidenote"><i>How a Mans heart is placed in his Body.</i></div>

<p>That the <i>Heart</i> of Man is seated in the left side, is an asseveration,
which strictly taken, is refutable by inspection, whereby it appears the
base and centre thereof is in the midst of the chest; true it is, that
the Mucro or Point thereof inclineth unto the left; for by this position
it giveth way unto the ascension of the midriff, and by reason of the
hollow vein could not commodiously deflect unto the right. From which
diversion, nevertheless we cannot so properly say tis placed in the
left, as that it consisteth in the middle, that is, where its centre
resteth; for so do we usually say a Gnomon or Needle is in the middle of
a Dial, although the extreams may respect the North or South, and
approach the circumference thereof.</p>

<p>The ground of this mistake is a general observation from the pulse or
motion of the <i>Heart</i>, which is more sensible on this side; but the
reason hereof is not to be drawn from the situation of the <i>Heart</i>, but
the site of the left ventricle wherein the vital Spirits are laboured;
and also the great Artery that conveieth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span> them out; both which are
situated on the left. Upon this reason Epithems or cordial Applications
are justly applied unto the left Breast; and the Wounds under the fifth
Rib may be more suddenly destructive if made on the sinister side, and
the Spear of the Souldier that peirced our Saviour, is not improperly
described, when Painters direct it a little towards the left.</p>

<p>The other ground is more particular and upon inspection; for in dead
Bodies especially lying upon the Spine, the <i>Heart</i> doth seem to incline
unto the left. Which happeneth not from its proper site; but besides its
sinistrous gravity, is drawn that way by the great Artery, which then
subsideth and haleth the <i>Heart</i> unto it. And therefore strictly taken,
the <i>Heart</i> is seated in the middle of the Chest; but after a careless
and inconsiderate aspection, or according to the readiest sense of
pulsation, we shall not quarrel, if any affirm it is seated toward the
left. And in these considerations must <i>Aristotle</i> be salved, when he
affirmeth the <i>Heart</i> of Man is placed in the left side, and thus in a
popular acception may we receive the Periphrasis of <i>Persius</i>;
<span class="sidenote"> &mdash;&mdash;Leva in parte mamill√¶.</span> when he taketh the part under the left Pap for
the <i>Heart</i>; and if rightly apprehended, it concerneth not this
controversie, when it is said in <i>Ecclesiastes</i>: The <i>Heart</i> of a wise
Man is in the right side, but that of a Fool in the left, for thereby
may be implied, that the <i>Heart</i> of a wise Man delighteth in the right
way, or in the path of Vertue; that of a Fool in the left or road of
Vice; according to the mystery of the Letter of <i>Pythagoras</i>, or that
expression in <i>Jonah</i>, concerning sixscore thousand, that could not
discern between their right hand and their left, or knew not good from
evil.</p>

<p>That assertion also that Man proportionally hath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span> the largest brain, I
did I confess somewhat doubt; and conceived it might have failed in
Birds, especially such as having little Bodies, have yet large Cranies,
and seem to contain much Brain, as <i>Snipes</i>, <i>Woodcocks</i>, etc. But upon
trial I find it very true. The Brains of a Man, <i>Archangelus</i> and
<i>Bauhinus</i> observe, to weigh four pound, and sometime five and a half.
If therefore a Man weigh one hundred and fourty pounds, and his Brain
but five, his Weight is 27. times as much as his brain, deducting the
weight of that five pound which is allowed for it. Now in a Snipe, which
weighed four ounces two dragms, I find the Brains to weigh but half a
dragm; so that the weight of the Body (allowing for the Brain) exceeded
the weight of the Brain, sixty seven times and an half.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p><p>More controvertible it seemeth in the Brains of Sparrows, whose Cranies
are rounder, and so of larger capacity: and most of all in the Heads of
Birds, upon the first formation in the Egg, wherein the Head seems
larger then all the Body, and the very Eyes almost as big as either. A
Sparrow in the total we found to weigh seven dragms and four and twenty
grans; whereof the Head a dragm, but the Brain not fifteen grains; which
answereth not fully the proportion of the brain of Man. And therefore it
is to be taken of the whole Head with the Brains, when <i>Scaliger</i>
<span class="sidenote">Histor. Animal. <i>lib.</i> 1.</span> objecteth that the Head of a Man is the
fifteenth part of his Body; that of a Sparrow, scarce the fifth.</p>

<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of Pleurisies.</span></h2>


<div class="sidenote"><i>What a Pleurisie is.</i></div>

<p>That <i>Pleurisies</i> are only on the left side, is a popular Tenent not
only absurd but dangerous. From the misapprehension hereof, men omitting
the opportunity of remedies, which otherwise they would not neglect.
Chiefly occasioned by the Ignorance of <i>Anatomy</i> and the extent of the
part affected; which in an exquisite <i>Pleurisie</i> is determined to be the
skin or membrane which invested the Ribs, for so it is defined,
<i>Inflammatio membran√¶ costas succingentis</i>; An Inflammation, either
simple, consisting only of an hot and sanguineous affluxion; or else
denominable from other humours, according to the predominancy of
melancholy, flegm, or choler. The membrane thus inflamed, is properly
called <i>Pleura</i>; from whence the disease hath its name; and this
investeth not only one side, but overspreadeth the cavity of the chest,
and affordeth a common coat unto the parts contained therein.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p><p>Now therefore the <i>Pleura</i> being common unto both sides, it is not
reasonable to confine the inflammation unto one, nor strictly to
determine it is alwaies in the side; but sometimes before and behind,
that is, inclining to the Spine or Breast-bone; for thither this Coat
extendeth; and therefore with equal propriety we may affirm, that ulcers
of the lungs, or Apostems of the brain do happen only in the left side;
or that Ruptures are confinable unto one side, whereas the Peritoneum or
Rib of the Belly may be broke, or its perforations relaxed in either.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV_PE_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV_PE_IV">CHAPTER IV</a>
<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of the Ring-finger.</span></h2>


<p>An opinion there is, which magnifies the fourth <i>Finger</i> of the left
Hand; presuming therein a cordial relation, that a particular vessel,
nerve, vein or artery is conferred thereto from the heart, and therefore
that especially hath the honour to bear our Rings. Which was not only
the Christian practice in Nuptial contracts, but observed by Heathens,
as <i>Alexander ab Alexandro</i>, <i>Gellius</i>, <i>Macrobius</i> and <i>Pierius</i> have
delivered, as <i>Levinus Lemnius</i> hath confirmed, who affirms this
peculiar vessel to be an artery, and not a Nerve, as Antiquity hath
conceived it; adding moreover that <i>Rings</i> hereon peculiarly affect the
Heart; that in Lipothymies or swoundings he used the frication of this
<i>Finger</i> with saffron and gold: that the ancient Physitians mixed up
their Medicines herewith; that this is seldom or last of all affected
with the Gout, and when that becometh nodous, Men continue not long
after. Notwithstanding all which we remain unsatisfied, nor can we think
the reasons alleadged sufficiently establish the preheminency of this
<i>Finger</i>.</p>

<p>For first, Concerning the practice of Antiquity, the custom was not
general to wear their <i>Rings</i> either on this hand or <i>Finger</i>; for it is
said, and that emphatically in <i>Jeremiah</i>, <i>Si fuerit Jeconias filius
Joachim regis Jud√¶ annulus in manu dextr√¢ me√¢, inde evallam eum</i>: Though
<i>Coniah</i> the son of <i>Joachim</i> King of <i>Judah</i>, were the signet on my
right Hand, yet would I pluck thee thence. So is it observed by <i>Pliny</i>,
that in the portraits of their Gods, the <i>Rings</i> were worn on the
<i>Finger</i> next the <i>Thumb</i>; that the <i>Romans</i> wore them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span> also upon their
little Finger, as <i>Hero</i> is described in <i>Petronius</i>; some wore them on
the middle <i>Finger</i>, as the ancient <i>Gaules</i> and <i>Britans</i>; and some
upon the fore-<i>Finger</i>, as is deduceable from <i>Julius Pollux</i>: who names
that <i>Ring</i> Corionos.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Rings anciently of Iron.</i></div>

<p>Again, That the practice of the ancients, had any such respect of
cordiality or reference unto the Heart, will much be doubted, if we
consider their Rings were made of iron; such was that of <i>Prometheus</i>,
who is conceived the first that brought them in use. So, as <i>Pliny</i>
affirmeth, for many years the <i>Senators</i> of <i>Rome</i> did not wear any
Rings of Gold; but the slaves wore generally Iron Rings until their
manumission or preferment to some dignity. That the <i>Lacedemonians</i>
continued their Iron Rings unto his daies, <i>Pliny</i> also delivereth, and
surely they used few of Gold; for beside that <i>Lycurgus</i> prohibited that
mettal, we read in <i>Athen√¶us</i>, that having a desire to guild the face of
<i>Apollo</i>, they enquired of the Oracle where they might purchase so much
Gold; and were directed unto <i>Cr≈ìsus</i> King of <i>Lydia</i>.</p>

<p>Moreover whether the Ancients had any such intention, the grounds which
they conceived in Vein, Nerve or Artery, are not to be justified, nor
will inspection confirm a peculiar vessel in this Finger. For as
<i>Anatomy</i> informeth, the Basilica vein dividing into two branches below
the cubit, the outward sendeth two surcles unto the thumb, two unto the
fore-finger, and one unto the middle finger in the inward side; the
other branch of the Basilica sendeth one surcle unto the outside of the
middle finger, two unto the Ring, and as many unto the little fingers;
so that they all proceed from the Basilica, and are in equal numbers
derived unto every one. In the same manner are the branches of the
axillary artery distributed into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span> the Hand; for below the cubit it
divideth into two parts, the one running along the <i>Radius</i>, and passing
by the wrest or place of the pulse, is at the <i>Fingers</i> subdivided into
three Branches; whereof the first conveyeth two surcles unto the
<i>Thumb</i>, the second as many to the fore-<i>Finger</i>, and the third one unto
the middle <i>Finger</i>; the other or lower division of the artery
descendeth by the ulna, and furnisheth the other <i>Fingers</i>; that is the
middle with one surcle, and the <i>Ring</i> and little <i>Fingers</i> with two.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Whence the Nerves proceed.</i></span> As for the Nerves, they are disposed
much after the same manner, and have their original from the Brain, and
not the Heart, as many of the Ancients conceived; which is so far from
affording Nerves unto other parts, that it receiveth very few it self
from the sixth conjugation, or pair of Nerves in the Brain.</p>

<p>Lastly, These propagations being communicated unto both Hands, we have
no greater reason to wear our <i>Rings</i> on the left, then on the right;
nor are there cordial considerations in the one, more then the other.
And therefore when <i>Forestus</i> for the stanching of blood makes use of
Medical applications unto the fourth <i>Finger</i>, he confines not that
practice unto the left, but varieth the side according to the nostril
bleeding. So in Feavers, where the Heart primarily suffereth, we apply
Medicines unto the wrests of either arm; so we touch the pulse of both,
and judge of the affections of the Heart by the one as well as the
other. And although in indispositions of Liver or Spleen, considerations
are made in <i>Phlebotomy</i> respectively to their situation; yet when the
Heart is affected, Men have thought it as effectual to bleed on the
right as the left; and although also it may be thought, a nearer respect
is to be had of the left, because the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span> great artery proceeds from the
left ventricle, and so is nearer that arm; it admits not that
consideration. For under the channel bones the artery divideth into two
great branches, from which trunk or point of division, the distance unto
either Hand is equal, and the consideration also answerable.</p>

<p>All which with many respective Niceties, in order unto parts, sides, and
veines, are now become of less consideration, by the new and noble
doctrine of the circulation of the blood.</p>

<p>And therefore <i>Macrobius</i> discussing the point, hath alleadged another
reason; affirming that the gestation of <i>Rings</i> upon this Hand and
<i>Finger</i>, might rather be used for their conveniency and preservation,
then any cordial relation. For at first (saith he) it was both free and
usual to wear <i>Rings</i> on either Hand; but after that luxury encreased,
when pretious gems and rich insculptures were added, the custom of
wearing them on the right Hand was translated unto the left; for that
Hand being less imployed, thereby they were best preserved. And for the
same reason they placed them on this <i>Finger</i>; for the <i>Thumb</i> was too
active a <i>Finger</i>, and is commonly imployed with either of the rest: the
Index or fore-<i>Finger</i> was too naked whereto to commit their
pretiosities, and hath the tuition of the <i>Thumb</i> scarce unto the second
joint: the middle and little <i>Finger</i> they rejected as extreams, and too
big or too little for their <i>Rings</i>, and of all chose out the fourth, as
being least used of any, as being guarded on either side, and having in
most this peculiar condition, that it cannot be extended alone and by
itself, but will be accompanied by some <i>Finger</i> on either side. And to
this opinion assenteth <i>Alexander ab Alexandro</i>, <i>Annulum nuptialem
prior √¶tas in sinistr√¢ ferebat, crediderim ne attereretur</i>.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>Now that which begat or promoted the common opinion, was the common
conceit that the Heart was seated on the left side; but how far this is
verified, we have before declared. The <i>Egyptian</i> practice hath much
advanced the same, who unto this <i>Finger</i> derived a Nerve from the
Heart; and therefore the Priest anointed the same with precious oyls
before the Altar. But how weak <i>Anatomists</i> they were, which were so
good Embalmers, we have already shewed. And though this reason took most
place, yet had they another which more commended that practice: and that
was the number whereof this <i>Finger</i> was an Hieroglyphick. For by
holding down the fourth <i>Finger</i> of the left Hand, while the rest were
extended, they signified the perfect and magnified number of six. For as
<i>Pierius</i> hath graphically declared, Antiquity expressed numbers by the
<i>Fingers</i> of either Hand: on the left they accounted their digits and
articulate numbers unto an hundred; on the right Hand hundreds and
thousands; the depressing this <i>Finger</i>, which in the left Hand implied
but six, in the right indigitated six hundred. In this way of
numeration, may we construe that of <i>Juvenal</i> concerning <i>Nestor</i>,</p>

<p>And however it were intended, in this sense it will be very elegant what
is delivered of Wisdom, <i>Prov.</i> 3. Length of daies is in her right Hand,
and in her left Hand riches and honour.</p>

<p>As for the observation of <i>Lemnius</i> an eminent Physitian, concerning the
Gout; however it happened in his Country, we may observe it otherwise in
ours; that is, that chiragrical persons do suffer in this <i>Finger</i> as
well as in the rest, and sometimes first of all, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span> sometimes no where
else. And for the mixing up medicines herewith; it is rather an argument
of opinion, then any considerable effect; and we as highly conceive of
the practice in <i>Diapalma</i>, that is, in the making of that plaister, to
stir it with the stick of a Palm.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V_PE_IV" id="CHAPTER_V_PE_IV">CHAPTER V</a>
<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of the right and left Hand.</span></h2>


<p>It is also suspicious, and not with that certainty to be received, what
is generally believed concerning the right and left hand; that Men
naturally make use of the right, and that the use of the other is a
digression or aberration from that way which nature generally intendeth.
We do not deny that almost all Nations have used this hand, and ascribed
a preheminence thereto: hereof a remarkable passage there is in the 48.
of <i>Genesis</i>, And <i>Joseph</i> took them both, <i>Ephraim</i> in his right hand
towards <i>Israels</i> left hand, and <i>Manasses</i> in his left hand towards
<i>Israels</i> right hand, and <i>Israel</i> stretched out his right hand and laid
it upon <i>Ephraims</i> head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon
<i>Manasses</i> head, guiding his hands wittingly, for <i>Manasses</i> was the
first-born; and when <i>Joseph</i> saw that his father laid his right hand
upon the head of <i>Ephraim</i>, it displeased him, and he held up his
fathers hand to remove it from <i>Ephraims</i> head unto <i>Manasses</i> head, and
<i>Joseph</i> said, Not so my father, for this is the first-born, put thy
right hand upon his head: The like appeareth from the ordinance of
<i>Moses</i> in the consecration of their Priests, Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span> shalt thou kill the
Ram, and take of his blood, and put it upon the tip of the right ear of
<i>Aaron</i>, and upon the tip of the right ear of his sons, and upon the
thumb of the right hand, and upon the great toe of the right foot, and
sprinkle the blood on the Altar round about. That the <i>Persians</i> were
wont herewith to plight their faith, is testified by <i>Diodorus</i>: That
the <i>Greeks</i> and <i>Romans</i> made use hereof, beside the testimony of
divers Authors, is evident from their custom of discumbency at their
meals, which was upon their left side, for so their right hand was free,
and ready for all service. As also from the conjunction of the right
hands and not the left observable in the <i>Roman</i> medals of concord. Nor
was this only in use with divers Nations of Men, but was the custom of
whole Nations of Women; as is deduceable from the Amazones in the
amputation of their right breast, whereby they had the freer use of
their bow. All which do seem to declare a natural preferment of the one
unto motion before the other; wherein notwithstanding in submission to
future information, we are unsatisfied unto great dubitation.</p>

<p>For first, if there were a determinate prepotency in the right, and such
as ariseth from a constant root in nature, we might expect the same in
other animals, whose parts are also differenced by dextrality; wherein
notwithstanding we cannot discover a distinct and complying account; for
we find not that <i>Horses</i>, <i>Buls</i>, or <i>Mules</i>, are generally stronger on
this side. As for Animals whose forelegs more sensibly supply the use of
arms, they hold, if not an equality in both, a prevalency oft-times in
the other, as <i>Squirrels</i>, <i>Apes</i>, and <i>Monkies</i>; the same is also
discernable in <i>Parrets</i>, who feed themselves more commonly by the
left-leg, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span> Men observe that the Eye of a Tumbler is biggest, not
constantly in one, but in the bearing side.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Whence the dextral activity in men proceeds.</i></div>

<p>That there is also in Men a natural prepotency in the right, we cannot
with constancy affirm, if we make observation in children; who permitted
the freedom of both, do oft-times confine unto the left, and are not
without great difficulty restrained from it. And therefore this
prevalency is either uncertainly placed in the laterality, or custom
determines its differency. Which is the resolution of <i>Aristotle</i> in
that Problem, which enquires why the right side being better then the
left, is equal in the senses? because, saith he, the right and left do
differ by use and custom, which have no place in the senses. For right
and left as parts inservient unto the motive faculty, are differenced by
degrees from use and assuefaction, according whereto the one grows
stronger and oft-times bigger then the other. But in the senses it is
otherwise; for they acquire not their perfection by use or custom, but
at the first we equally hear and see with one Eye, as well as with
another. And therefore, were this indifferency permitted, or did not
constitution, but nature determine dextrality, there would be many more
Scevolaes then are delivered in story; nor needed we to draw examples of
the left, from the sons of the right hand;<span class="sidenote">Benjamin filius dextr√¶.</span>
as we read of seven thousand in the Army of the <i>Benjamites</i>. True it
is, that although there be an indifferency in either, or a prevalency
indifferent in one, yet is it most reasonable for uniformity, and sundry
respective uses, that Men should apply themselves to the constant use of
one; for there will otherwise arise anomalous disturbances in manual
actions, not only in civil and artificial, but also in Military affairs,
and the several actions of war.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>Secondly, The grounds and reasons alleadged for the right, are not
satisfactory, and afford no rest in their decision. <i>Scaliger</i> finding a
defect in the reason of <i>Aristotle</i>, introduceth one of no less
deficiency himself; <i>Ratio materialis</i> (saith he) <i>sanguinis crassitudo
simul et multitudo</i>; that is, the reason of the vigour of this side, is
the crassitude and plenty of blood; but this is not sufficient; for the
crassitude or thickness of blood affordeth no reason why one arm should
be enabled before the other, and the plenty thereof, why both not
enabled equally. <i>Fallopius</i> is of another conceit, deducing the reason
from the Azygos or <i>vena sine pari</i>, a large and considerable vein
arising out of the <i>cava</i> or hollow vein, before it enters the right
ventricle of the Heart, and placed only in the right side. But neither
is this perswasory; for the Azygos communicates no branches unto the
arms or legs on either side, but disperseth into the Ribs on both, and
in its descent doth furnish the left Emulgent with one vein, and the
first vein of the loins on the right side with another; which manner of
derivation doth not confer a peculiar addition unto either. <i>C√¶lius
Rodiginus</i> undertaking to give a reason of Ambidexters and <i>Left-handed</i>
Men, delivereth a third opinion: Men, saith he, are Ambidexters, and use
both <i>Hands</i> alike, when the heat of the Heart doth plentifully disperse
into the left side, and that of the Liver into the right, and the spleen
be also much dilated; but Men are <i>Left-handed</i> when ever it happeneth
that the Heart and Liver are seated on the left-side; or when the Liver
is on the right side, yet so obducted and covered with thick skins, that
it cannot diffuse its vertue into the right. Which reasons are no way
satisfactory; for herein the spleen is injustly introduced to invigorate
the sinister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span> side, which being dilated it would rather infirm and
debilitate. As for any tunicles or skins which should hinder the Liver
from enabling dextral parts; we must not conceive it diffuseth its
vertue by meer irradiation, but by its veins and proper vessels, which
common skins and teguments cannot impede. And for the seat of the Heart
and Liver in one side, whereby Men become <i>Left-handed</i>, it happeneth
too rarely to countenance an effect so common; for the seat of the Liver
on the left side is monstrous, and rarely to be met with in the
observations of Physitians. Others not considering ambidextrous and
<i>Left-handed</i> Men, do totally submit unto the efficacy of the Liver;
which though seated on the right side, yet by the subclavian division
doth equidistantly communicate its activity unto either Arm; nor will it
salve the doubts of observation; for many are <i>Right-handed</i> whose
Livers are weakly constituted, and many use the left, in whom that part
is strongest; and we observe in Apes, and other animals, whose Liver is
in the right, no regular prevalence therein.</p>

<p>And therefore the brain, especially the spinal marrow, which is but the
brain prolonged, hath a fairer plea hereto; for these are the principles
of motion, wherein dextrality consists; and are divided within and
without the Crany. By which division transmitting Nerves respectively
unto either side; according to the indifferency, or original and native
prepotency, there ariseth an equality in both, or prevalency on either
side. And so may it be made out, what many may wonder at, why some most
actively use the contrary Arm and Leg; for the vigour of the one
dependeth upon the upper part of the spine, but the other upon the
lower.</p>

<p>And therefore many things are Philosophically delivered <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>concerning
right and left, which admit of some suspension. That a Woman upon a
masculine conception advanceth her right Leg, will not be found to
answer strick observation. That males are conceived in the right side of
the womb, females in the left, though generally delivered, and supported
by ancient testimony, will make no infallible account; it happening oft
times that males and females do lie upon both sides, and Hermaphrodites
for ought we know on either. It is also suspitious what is delivered
concerning the right and left testicle, that males are begotten from the
one, and females from the other. For though the left seminal vein
proceedeth from the emulgent, and is therefore conceived to carry down a
serous and feminine matter; yet the seminal Arteries which send forth
the active materials, are both derived from the great Artery. Beside
this original of the left vein was thus contrived, to avoid the
pulsation of the great Artery, over which it must have passed to attain
unto the testicle. Nor can we easily infer such different effects from
the divers situation of parts which have one end and office; for in the
kidneys which have one office, the right is seated lower then the left,
whereby it lieth free, and giveth way unto the Liver. And therefore also
that way which is delivered for masculine generation, to make a strait
ligature about the left testicle, thereby to intercept the evacuation of
that part, deserveth consideration. For one sufficeth unto generation,
as hath been observed in semicastration, and oft times in carnous
ruptures. <span class="sidenote"><i>How an Horse or Bull may generate after they be gelt.</i></span>
Beside, the seminal ejaculation proceeds not immediately from the
testicle, but from the spermatick glandules; and therefore <i>Aristotle</i>
affirms (and reason cannot deny) that although there be nothing diffused
from the testicles, an <i>Horse</i> or <i>Bull</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span> may generate after castration;
that is, from the stock and remainder of seminal matter, already
prepared and stored up in the Prostates or grandules of generation.</p>

<p>Thirdly, Although we should concede a right and left in Nature, yet in
this common and received account we may err from the proper acception;
mistaking one side for another; calling that in Man and other animals
the right which is the left, and that the left which is the right, and
that in some things right and left, which is not properly either.</p>

<p>For first the right and left, are not defined by Phylosophers according
to common acception, that is, respectively from one Man unto another, or
any constant site in each; as though that should be the right in one,
which upon confront or facing, stands athwart or diagonally unto the
other; but were distinguished according to the activity and predominant
locomotion upon either side. Thus <i>Aristotle</i> in his excellent Tract <i>de
incessu animalium</i>, ascribeth six positions unto Animals, answering the
three dimensions; which he determineth not by site or position unto the
Heavens, but by their faculties and functions; and these are <i>Imum
summum</i>, <i>Ante Retro</i>, <i>Dextra et Sinistra</i>: that is, the superiour
part, where the aliment is received, that the lower extream, where it is
last expelled; so he termeth a Man a plant inverted; for he supposeth
the root of a Tree the head or upper part thereof, whereby it receiveth
its aliment, although therewith it respects the Center of the Earth, but
with the other the Zenith; and this position is answerable unto
longitude. Those parts are anteriour and measure profundity, where the
senses, especially the Eyes are placed, and those posterior which are
opposite hereunto. The dextrous and sinistrous parts of the body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span> make
up the latitude; and are not certain and inalterable like the other; for
that, saith he, is the right side, from whence the motion of the body
beginneth, that is, the active or moving side; but that the sinister
which is the weaker or more quiescent part. Of the same determination
were the <i>Platonicks</i> and <i>Pythagoreans</i> before him; who conceiving the
heavens an animated body, named the <i>East</i>, the right or dextrous part,
from whence began their motion: and thus the <i>Greeks</i>, from whence the
<i>Latins</i> have borrowed their appellation, have named this hand Œ¥Œ≠ŒæŒπŒ±,
denominating it not from the site, but office, from Œ¥Œ≠œáŒøŒºŒ±Œπ <i>capio</i>,
that is, the hand which receiveth, or is usually implied in that action.</p>

<p>Now upon these grounds we are most commonly mistaken, defining that by
situation which they determined by motion; and giving the term of right
hand to that which doth not properly admit it. For first, Many in their
Infancy are sinistrously disposed, and divers continue all their life
·ºàœÅŒπœÉœÑŒµœÅŒøŒØ, that is, left handed, and have but weak and imperfect use of
the right; now unto these, that hand is properly the right, and not the
other esteemed so by situation. Thus may <i>Aristotle</i> be made out, when
he affirmeth the right claw of <i>Crabs</i> and <i>Lobsters</i> is biggest, if we
take the right for the most vigorous side, and not regard the relative
situation: for the one is generally bigger then the other, yet not
alwayes upon the same side. So may it be verified what is delivered by
<i>Scaliger</i> in his Comment, that Palsies do oftnest happen upon the left
side, if understood in this sense; the most vigorous part protecting it
self, and protruding the matter upon the weaker and less resistive side.
And thus the Law of Common-Weals, that cut off the right hand of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
Malefactors, if Philosophically executed, is impartial; otherwise the
amputation not equally punisheth all.</p>

<p>Some are ·ºàŒºœÜŒπŒ¥Œ≠ŒæŒπŒøŒπ, that is, ambidextrous or right handed on both
sides; which happeneth only unto strong and Athletical bodies, whose
heat and spirits are able to afford an ability unto both. <span class="sidenote"><i>Apt for
contention.</i></span> And therefore <i>Hippocrates</i> saith, that Women are not
ambidextrous, that is, not so often as Men; for some are found, which
indifferently make use of both. And so may <i>Aristotle</i> say, that only
Men are ambidexterous; of this constitution was <i>Asterop√¶us</i> in <i>Homer</i>,
and <i>Parthenopeus</i> the <i>Theban</i> Captain in <i>Statius</i>: and of the same,
do some conceive our Father <i>Adam</i> to have been, as being perfectly
framed, and in a constitution admitting least defect. Now in these Men
the right hand is on both sides, and that is not the left which is
opposite unto the right, according to common acception.</p>

<p>Again, Some are ·ºàŒºœÜŒ±œÅŒπœÉœÑŒµœÅŒø·Ω∂, as <i>Galen</i> hath expressed it;
that is, ambilevous or left-handed on both sides; such as with agility
and vigour have not the use of either: who are not gymnastically
<span class="sidenote"><i>Strongly or fit for corporal exercise.</i></span> composed: nor actively use
those parts. Now in these there is no right hand: of this constitution
are many Women, and some Men, who though they accustom themselves unto
either hand, do dexterously make use of neither. And therefore although
the Political advice of <i>Aristotle</i> be very good, that Men should
accustom themselves to the command of either hand: yet cannot the
execution or performance thereof be general: for though there be many
found that can use both, yet will there divers remain that can
strenuously make use of neither.</p>

<p>Lastly, These lateralities in Man are not only fallible, if relatively
determined unto each other, but made in reference unto the heavens and
quarters of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span> Globe: for those parts are not capable of these
conditions in themselves, nor with any certainty respectively derived
from us, nor from them to us again. And first in regard of their proper
nature, the heavens admit not these sinister and dexter respects; there
being in them no diversity or difference, but a simplicity of parts, and
equiformity in motion continually succeeding each other; so that from
what point soever we compute, the account will be common unto the whole
circularity. And therefore though it be plausible, it is not of
consequence hereto what is delivered by <i>Solinus</i>. That Man was
therefore a Microcosm or little World, because the dimensions of his
positions were answerable unto the greater. For as in the Heavens the
distance of the North and Southern pole, which are esteemed the
superiour and inferiour points, is equal unto the space between the East
and West, accounted the dextrous and sinistrous parts thereof; so is it
also in Man, for the extent of his fathome or distance betwixt the
extremity of the fingers of either hand upon expansion, is equal unto
the space between the sole of the foot and the crown. But this doth but
petionarily infer a dextrality in the Heavens, and we may as reasonably
conclude a right and left laterality in the Ark or naval edifice of
<i>Noah</i>. For the length thereof was thirty cubits, the breadth fifty, and
the height or profundity thirty; which well agreeth unto the proportion
of Man, whose length, that is, a perpendicular from the vertex unto the
sole of the foot is sextuple unto his breadth, or a right line drawn
from the ribs of one side to another; and decuble unto his profundity;
that is, a direct line between the breast bone and the spine.</p>

<p>Again, They receive not these conditions with any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span> assurance or
stability from our selves. For the relative foundations and points of
denomination, are not fixed and certain, but variously designed
according to imagination. The Philosopher accounts that East from whence
the Heavens begin their motion. The Astronomer regarding the South and
Meridian Sun, calls that the dextrous part of Heaven which respecteth
his right hand; and that is the West. Poets respecting the West, assign
the name of right unto the North, which regardeth their right hand; and
so must that of <i>Ovid</i> be explained <i>utque du√¶ dextr√¢ Zon√¶ totidemqu√¶
sinistr√¢</i>. <span class="sidenote"><i>Declarable from the original expression</i>, Psalm 89.
13.</span> But Augurs or Southsayers turning their face to the East, did make
the right in the South; which was also observed by the <i>Hebrews</i> and
<i>Chaldeans</i>. Now if we name the quarters of Heaven respectively unto our
sides, it will be no certain or invariable denomination. For if we call
that the right side of Heaven which is seated Easterly unto us, when we
regard the Meridian Sun; the inhabitants beyond the √Üquator and Southern
Tropick when they face us, regarding the Meridian, will contrarily
define it; for unto them, the opposite part of Heaven will respect the
left, and the Sun arise to their right.</p>

<p>And thus have we at large declared that although the right be most
commonly used, yet hath it no regular or certain root in nature. Since
it is not confirmable from other Animals: Since in Children it seems
either indifferent or more favourable in the other; but more reasonable
for uniformity in action, that Men accustom unto one: Since the grounds
and reasons urged for it, do not sufficiently support it: Since if there
be a right and stronger side in nature, yet may we mistake in its
denomination; calling that the right which is the left, and the left
which is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span> right. Since some have one right, some both, some neither.
And lastly, Since these affections in Man are not only fallible in
relation unto one another, but made also in reference unto the Heavens,
they being not capable of these conditions in themselves, nor with any
certainty from us, nor we from them again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p><p>And therefore what admission we ow unto many conceptions concerning
right and left, requireth circumspection. That is, how far we ought to
rely upon the remedy in <i>Kiranides</i>, that is, the left eye of an
<i>Hedg-hog</i> fried in oyl to procure sleep, and the right foot of a <i>Frog</i>
in a <i>Dears</i> skin for the <i>Gout</i>; or that to dream of the loss of right
or left tooth, presageth the death of male or female kindred, according
to the doctrine of <i>Artemidorus</i>. What verity there is in that numeral
conceit in the lateral division of Man by even and odd, ascribing the
odd unto the right side, and even unto the left; and so by parity or
imparity of letters in Mens names to determine misfortunes on either
side of their bodies; by which account in Greek numeration, <i>Heph√¶stus</i>
or <i>Vulcan</i> was lame in the right foot, and <i>Anibal</i> lost his right eye.
And lastly, what substance there is in that Auspicial principle, and
fundamental doctrine of Ariolation, that the left hand is ominous, and
that good things do pass sinistrously upon us, because the left hand of
man respected the right hand of the Gods, which handed their favours
unto us.</p>

<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of Swimming and Floating.</span></h2>


<p>That Men swim naturally, if not disturbed by fear; that Men being
drowned and sunk, do float the ninth day when their gall breaketh; that
Women drowned, swim prone, but Men supine, or upon their backs; are
popular affirmations, whereto we cannot assent. And first, that Man
should swim naturally, because we observe it is no lesson unto other
Animals, we are not forward to conclude; for other Animals swim in the
same manner as they go, and need no other way of motion for natation in
the water, then for progression upon the land. And this is true whether
they move <i>per latera</i>, that is, two legs of one side together, which is
Tollutation or ambling; or <i>per diametrum</i>, lifting one foot before, and
the cross foot behind, which is succussation or trotting; or whether
<i>per frontem</i> or <i>quadratum</i>, as <i>Scaliger</i> terms it, upon a square
base, the legs of both sides moving together, as <i>Frogs</i> and salient
Animals, which is properly called leaping. For by these motions they are
able to support and impel themselves in the water, without alteration in
the stroak of their legs, or position of their bodies.</p>

<p>But with Man it is performed otherwise; for in regard of site he alters
his natural posture and swimmeth prone; whereas he walketh erect. Again,
in progression the arms move parallel to the legs, and the arms and legs
unto each other; but in natation they intersect and make all sorts of
angles. And lastly, in progressive motion, the arms and legs do move
successively, but in natation both together; all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span> which aptly to
perform, and so as to support and advance the body, is a point of Art,
and such as some in their young and docile years could never attain. But
although swimming be acquired by art, yet is there somewhat more of
nature in it then we observe in other habits, nor will it strictly fall
under that definition; for once obtained, it is not to be removed; nor
is there any who from disuse did ever yet forget it.</p>

<p>Secondly, That persons drowned arise and float the ninth day when their
gall breaketh, is a questionable determination both in the time and
cause. For the time of floating, it is uncertain according to the time
of putrefaction, which shall retard or accelerate according to the
subject and season of the year; for as we observed, <i>Cats</i> and <i>Mice</i>
will arise unequally, and at different times, though drowned at the
same. Such as are fat do commonly float soonest, for their bodies
soonest ferment, and that substance approacheth nearest unto air: and
this is one of <i>Aristotles</i> reasons why dead <i>Eels</i> will not float,
because saith he, they have but slender bellies, and little fat.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Why drowned bodies float after a time.</i></div>

<p>As for the cause, it is not so reasonably imputed unto the breaking of
the gall as the putrefaction or corruptive firmentation of the body,
whereby the unnatural heat prevailing, the putrifying parts do suffer a
turgescence and inflation, and becoming aery and spumous affect to
approach the air, and ascend unto the surface of the water. And this is
also evidenced in Eggs, whereof the sound ones sink, and such as are
addled swim, as do also those which are termed hypenemia or wind-eggs;
and this is also a way to separate seeds, whereof such as are corrupted
and steril, swim; and this agreeth not only unto the seed of plants
lockt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span> up and capsulated in their husks, but also unto the sperm and
seminal humour of Man; for such a passage hath <i>Aristotle</i> upon the
Inquisition and test of its fertility.</p>

<p>That the breaking of the gall is not the cause hereof, experience hath
informed us. For opening the <i>abdomen</i>, and taking out the gall in
<i>Cats</i> and <i>Mice</i>, they did notwithstanding arise. And because we had
read in <i>Rhodiginus</i> of a Tyrant, who to prevent the emergency of
murdered bodies, did use to cut off their lungs, and found Mens minds
possessed with this reason; we committed some unto the water without
lungs, which notwithstanding floated with the others. And to compleat
the experiment, although we took out the guts and bladder, and also
perforated the Cranium, yet would they arise, though in a longer time.
From these observations in other Animals, it may not be unreasonable to
conclude the same in Man, who is too noble a subject on whom to make
them expressly, and the casual opportunity to rare almost to make any.
Now if any should ground this effect from gall or choler, because it is
the highest humour and will be above the rest; or being the fiery humour
will readiest surmount the water, we must confess in the common
putrescence it may promote elevation, which the breaking of the bladder
of gall, so small a part in Man, cannot considerably advantage.</p>

<p>Lastly, That Women drowned float prone, that is, with their bellies
downward, but Men supine or upward, is an assertion wherein the <i>hoti</i>
or point it self is dubious; and were it true, the reason alledged for
it, is of no validity. The reason yet currant was first expressed by
<i>Pliny</i>, <i>veluti pudori defunctorum parcente natur√¢</i>, nature modestly
ordaining this position to conceal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span> the shame of the dead; which hath
been taken up by <i>Solinus</i>, <i>Rhodiginus</i>, and many more. This indeed (as
<i>Scaliger</i> termeth it) is <i>ratio civilis non philosophica</i>, strong
enough for morality of Rhetoricks, not for Philosophy or Physicks. For
first, in nature the concealment of secret parts is the same in both
sexes, and the shame of their reveal equal: so <i>Adam</i> upon the tast of
the fruit was ashamed of his nakedness as well as <i>Eve</i>. And so likewise
in <i>America</i> and Countries unacquainted with habits, where modesty
conceals these parts in one sex, it doth it also in the other; and
therefore had this been the intention of nature, not only Women but Men
also had swimmed downwards; the posture in reason being common unto
both, where the intent is also common.</p>

<p>Again, While herein we commend the modesty, we condemn the wisdom of
nature: for that prone position we make her contrive unto the Woman,
were best agreeable unto the Man, in whom the secret parts are very
anteriour and more discoverable in a supine and upward posture. And
therefore <i>Scaliger</i> declining this reason, hath recurred unto another
from the difference of parts in both sexes; <i>Quod ventre vasto sunt
mulieres plenoque intestinis, itaque minus impletur et subsidet, inanior
maribus quibus nates pr√¶ponderant</i>: If so, then Men with great bellies
will float downward, and only <i>Callipyg√¶</i>, and Women largely composed
behind, upward. But <i>Anatomists</i> observe, that to make the larger cavity
for the Infant, the hanch bones in Women, and consequently the parts
appendant are more protuberant then they are in Men. They who ascribe
the cause unto the breasts of Women, take not away the doubt; for they
resolve not why children float downward, who are included in that sex,
though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span> not in the reason alleadged. But hereof we cease to discourse,
lest we undertake to afford a reason of the <a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>golden tooth, that is, to
invent or assign a cause when we remain unsatisfied or unassured of the
effect.</p>

<p>That a <i>Mare</i> will sooner drown then a <i>Horse</i>, though commonly
opinion&rsquo;d, is not I fear experienced: nor is the same observed, in the
drowning of <i>Whelps</i> and <i>Kitlins</i>. But that a Man cannot shut or open
his eyes under water, easie experiment may convict. Whether Cripples and
mutilated Persons, who have lost the greatest part of their thighs, will
not sink but float, their lungs being abler to waft up their bodies,
which are in others overpoised by the hinder legs; we have not made
experiment. Thus much we observe, that Animals drown downwards, and the
same is observable in <i>Frogs</i>, when the hinder legs are cut off. But in
the air most seem to perish headlong from high places; however <i>Vulcan</i>
thrown from Heaven, be made to fall on his feet.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII_PE_IV" id="CHAPTER_VII_PE_IV">CHAPTER VII</a>
<br /><span class="subtitle90">Concerning Weight.</span></h2>


<p>That Men weigh heavier dead then alive, if experiment hath not failed
us, we cannot reasonably grant. For though the trial hereof cannot so
well be made on the body of Man, nor will the difference be sensible in
the abate of scruples and dragms, yet can we not confirm the same in
lesser Animals, from whence the inference is good; and the affirmative
of <i>Pliny</i> saith, that it is true in all. For exactly weighing and
strangling a <i>Chicken</i> in the Scales; upon an immediate ponderation, we
could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span> discover no sensible difference in weight; but suffering it to
lie eight or ten hours, untill it grew perfectly cold, it weighed most
sensibly lighter; the like we attempted, and verified in <i>Mice</i>, and
performed their trials in Scales, that would turn upon the eighth or
tenth part of a grain.</p>

<p>Now whereas some alledge that spirits are lighter substances, and
naturally ascending, do elevate and waft the body upward, whereof dead
bodies being destitute, contract a greater gravity; although we concede
that spirits are light, comparatively unto the body, yet that they are
absolutely so, or have no weight at all, we cannot readily allow. For
since Philosophy affirmeth, that spirits are middle substances between
the soul and body, they must admit of some corporiety, which supposeth
weight or gravity. Beside, in carcasses warm, and bodies newly
disanimated, while transpiration remaineth, there do exhale and breath
out vaporous and fluid parts, which carry away some power of
gravitation. Which though we allow, we do not make answerable unto
living expiration; and therefore the <i>Chicken</i> or <i>Mice</i> were not so
light being dead, as they would have been after ten hours kept alive;
for in that space a man abateth many ounces. Nor if it had slept, for in
that space of sleep, a Man will sometimes abate fourty ounces; nor if it
had been in the middle of summer, for then a Man weigheth some pounds
less, then in the height of winter; according to experience, and the
statick Aphorisms of <i>Sanctorius</i>.</p>

<p>Again, Whereas Men affirm they perceive an addition of ponderosity in
dead bodies, comparing them usually unto blocks and stones, whensoever
they lift or carry them; this accessional preponderancy is rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span> in
appearance then reality. For being destitute of any motion, they confer
no relief unto the Agents, or Elevators; which makes us meet with the
same complaints of gravity in animated and living bodies, where the
Nerves subside, and the faculty locomotive seems abolished; as may be
observed in the lifting or supporting of persons inebriated,
Apoplectical, or in Lypothymies and swoundings.</p>

<p>Many are also of opinion, and some learned Men maintain, that Men are
lighter after meals then before, and that by a supply and addition of
spirits obscuring the gross ponderosity of the aliment ingested; but the
contrary hereof we have found in the trial of sundry persons in
different sex and ages. And we conceive Men may mistake if they
distinguish not the sense of levity unto themselves, and in regard of
the scale or decision of trutination. For after a draught of wine, a Man
may seem lighter in himself from sudden refection, although he be
heavier in the balance, from a corporal and ponderous addition; but a
Man in the morning is lighter in the scale, because in sleep some pounds
have perspired; and is also lighter unto himself, because he is
refected.</p>

<p>And to speak strictly, a Man that holds his breath is weightier while
his lungs are full, then upon expiration. For a bladder blown is
weightier then one empty, and if it contain a quart, expressed and
emptied it will abate about a quarter of a grain. And therefore we
somewhat mistrust the experiment of a pumice stone taken up by
<i>Montanus</i>, in his Comment upon <i>Avicenna</i>, where declaring how the
rarity of parts, and numerosity of pores, occasioneth a lightness in
bodies, he affirms that a pumice-stone powdered, is lighter then one
entire; which is an experiment beyond our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span> satisfaction; for beside that
abatement can hardly be avoided in the Trituration; if a bladder of good
capacity will scarce include a grain of air, a pumice of three or four
dragms, cannot be presumed to contain the hundred part thereof; which
will not be sensible upon the exactest beams we use. Nor is it to be
taken strictly which is delivered by the learned Lord <i>Verulam</i>, and
referred unto further experiment; That a dissolution of Iron in <i>aqua
fortis</i>, will bear as good weight as their bodies did before,
notwithstanding a great deal of waste by a thick vapour that issueth
during the working; for we cannot find it to hold neither in Iron nor
Copper, which is dissolved with less ebullition; and hereof we made
trial in Scales of good exactness: wherein if there be a defect, or such
as will not turn upon quarter grains, there may be frequent mistakes in
experiments of this nature. That also may be considered which is
delivered by <i>Hamerus Poppius</i><span class="sidenote">Basilica Antimonii.</span>, that
<i>Antimony</i> calcin&rsquo;d or reduced to ashes by a burning glass, although it
emit a gross and ponderous exhalation, doth rather exceed then abate its
former gravity. Nevertheless, strange it is; how very little and almost
insensible abatement there will be sometimes in such operations, or
rather some encrease, as in the refining of metals, in the test of bone
ashes, according to experience: and in a burnt brick, as <i>Monsieur de
Clave</i><span class="sidenote10"> Des Pierres.</span> affirmeth. Mistake may be made in this way of
trial, when the <i>Antimony</i> is not weighed immediately upon the
calcination; but permitted the air, it imbibeth the humidity thereof,
and so repaireth its gravity.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII_PE_IV" id="CHAPTER_VIII_PE_IV">CHAPTER VIII</a>
<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of the passage of Meat and Drink.</span></h2>


<p>That there are different passages for Meat and Drink, the Meat or dry
aliment descending by the one, the Drink or moistening vehicle by the
other, is a popular Tenent in our daies, but was the assertion of
learned men of old. For the same was affirmed by <i>Plato</i>, maintained by
<i>Eustathius</i> in <i>Macrobius</i>, and is deducible from <i>Eratosthenes</i>,
<i>Eupolis</i> and <i>Euripides</i>. Now herein Men contradict experience, not
well understanding <i>Anatomy</i>, and the use of parts. For at the Throat
there are two cavities or conducting parts; the one the Oesophagus or
Gullet, seated next the spine, a part official unto nutrition, and
whereby the aliment both wet and dry is conveied unto the stomack; the
other (by which tis conceived the Drink doth pass) is the weazon, rough
artery, or wind-pipe, a part inservient to voice and respiration; for
thereby the air descendeth into the lungs, and is communicated unto the
heart. And therefore all Animals that breath or have lungs, have also
the weazon; but many have the gullet or feeding channel, which have no
lungs or wind-pipe; as fishes which have gils, whereby the heart is
refrigerated; for such thereof as have lungs and respiration, are not
without the weazon, as Whales and cetaceous Animals.</p>

<p>Again, Beside these parts destin&rsquo;d to divers offices, there is a
peculiar provision for the wind-pipe, that is, a cartilagineous flap
upon the opening of the Larinx or Throttle, which hath an open cavity
for the admission of the air; but lest thereby either meat or drink
should descend, Providence hath placed the <i>Epiglottis</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span> <i>Ligula</i>, or
flap like an Ivy leaf, which alwaies closeth when we swallow, or when
the meat and drink passeth over it into the gullet. Which part although
all have not that breath, as all cetaceous and oviparous Animals, yet is
the weazon secured some other way; and therefore in Whales that breath,
least the water should get into the lungs, an ejection thereof is
contrived by a Fistula or spout at the head. And therefore also though
birds have no Epiglottis, yet can they so contract the rim or chink of
their Larinx, as to prevent the admission of wet or dry ingested; either
whereof getting in, occasioneth a cough, until it be ejected. <span class="sidenote"><i>Why
a man cannot drink and breath at once.</i></span> And this is the reason why a
Man cannot drink and breath at the same time; why, if we laugh while we
drink, the drink flies out at the nostrils; why, when the water enters
the weazon, Men are suddenly drowned; and thus must it be understood,
when we read<span class="sidenote">Anacreon <i>the Poet, if the story be taken literally</i>.</span>
of one that died by the seed of a Grape, and another by an hair in milk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p><p>Now if any shall still affirm, that some truth there is in the
assertion, upon the experiment of <i>Hippocrates</i>, who killing an Hog
after a red potion, found the tincture thereof in the Larinx; if any
will urge the same from medical practice, because in affections both of
Lungs and weazon, Physitians make use of syrupes, and lambitive
medicines; we are not averse to acknowledge, that some may distil and
insinuate into the wind-pipe, and medicines may creep down, as well as
the rheum before them; yet to conclude from hence, that air and water
have both one common passage, were to state the question upon the weaker
side of the distinction, and from a partial or guttulous irrigation, to
conclude a total descension.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX_PE_IV" id="CHAPTER_IX_PE_IV">CHAPTER IX</a>
<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of Sneezing.</span></h2>


<p>Concerning Sternutation or Sneezing, and the custom of saluting or
blessing upon that motion, it is pretended, and generally believed to
derive its original from a disease, wherein Sternutation proved mortal,
and such as Sneezed, died. And this may seem to be proved from <i>Carolus
Sigonius</i>, who in his History of <i>Italy</i>, makes mention of a Pestilence
in the time of <i>Gregory</i> the Great, that proved pernitious and deadly to
those that Sneezed. Which notwithstanding will not sufficiently
determine the grounds hereof: that custom having an elder <i>√Üra</i>, then
this Chronology affordeth.</p>

<p>For although the age of <i>Gregory</i> extend above a thousand, yet is this
custom mentioned by <i>Apuleius</i>, in the Fable of the Fullers wife, who
lived three hundred years before; by <i>Pliny</i> in that Problem of his,
<i>Cur Sternutantes salutantur</i>; and there are also reports that
<i>Tiberius</i> the Emperour, otherwise a very sower Man, would perform this
rite most punctually unto others, and expect the same from others, unto
himself. <i>Petronius Arbiter</i>, who lived before them both, and was
Proconsul of <i>Bythinia</i> in the raign of <i>Nero</i>, hath mentioned it in
these words, <i>Gyton collectione spiritus plenus, ter continuo ita
sternutavit ut grabatum concuteret, ad quem motum Eumolpus conversus,
Salvere Gytona jubet.</i> <i>C√¶lius Rhodiginus</i> hath an example hereof among
the <i>Greeks</i>, far antienter than these, that is, in the time of <i>Cyrus</i>
the younger; when consulting about their retreat, it chanced that one
among them Sneezed; at the noise whereof, the rest of the Souldiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
called upon <i>Jupiter Soter</i>. There is also in the Greek Anthology
<span class="sidenote"><i>A Collection of Greek Epigrams</i>, Titulo Œµ·º∞œÇ Œ¥œÖœÉŒµŒπŒ¥Œµ·øñœÇ.</span>, a
remarkable mention hereof in an Epigram, upon one <i>Proclus</i>; the Latin
whereof we shall deliver, as we find it often translated.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="line"><i>Non potis est Proclus digitis emungere nasum,</i></div>
<div class="line indent2"><i>Namq; est pro nasi mole pusilla manus:</i></div>
<div class="line"><i>Non vocat ille Jovem sternutans, quippe, nec audit</i></div>
<div class="line indent2"><i>Sternutamentum, tam procul aure sonat.</i></div>
<div class="line"><i>Proclus</i> with his hand his nose can never wipe,</div>
<div class="line indent2">His hand too little is his nose to gripe;</div>
<div class="line">He Sneezing calls not <i>Jove</i>, for why? he hears</div>
<div class="line indent2">Himself not Sneeze, the sound&rsquo;s so far from&rsquo;s ears.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Nor was this only an ancient custom among the <i>Greeks</i> and <i>Romans</i>, and
is still in force with us, but is received at this day in remotest parts
of <i>Africa</i>. <span class="sidenote25">De rebus Abassinorum</span>
For so we read in <i>Codignus</i>; that upon a Sneeze of the Emperour of <i>Monomotapa</i>, there
passed acclamations successively through the City. And as remarkable an
example there is of the same custom, <span class="sidenote25">Buxt. Lex. Chald.</span>in the remotest parts of the East,
recorded in the travels of <i>Pinto</i>.</p>

<p>But the history will run much higher, if we should take in the
<i>Rabinical</i> account hereof; that Sneezing was a mortal sign even from
the first Man; until it was taken off by the special supplication of
<i>Jacob</i>. From whence, as a thankful acknowledgment, this salutation
first began; and was after continued by the expression of <i>Tobim
Chaiim</i>, or <i>vita bona</i>, by standers by, upon all occasion of Sneezing.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Whence Sternutation or Sneezing proceeds.</i></div>

<p>Now the ground of this ancient custom was probably the opinion the
ancients held of sternutation, which they generally conceived, to be a
good sign or a bad, and so upon this motion accordingly used, a Salve or
ŒñŒµ·ø¶ œÉ·ø∂œÉŒøŒΩ, as a gratulation for the one, and a deprecation for the
other. Now of the waies whereby they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span> enquired and determined its
signality; the first was natural, arising from Physical causes, and
consequences oftentimes naturally succeeding this motion; and so it
might be justly esteemed a good sign. For Sneezing being properly a
motion of the brain, suddenly expelling through the nostrils what is
offensive unto it, it cannot but afford some evidence of its vigour; and
therefore saith <i>Aristotle</i><span class="sidenote"><i>Problem Sect. 33.</i></span>, they that hear it,
œÄœÅŒøœÉŒ∫œÖŒΩŒø·ø¶œÉŒπŒΩ ·Ω°œÇ ·ºµŒµœÅŒøŒΩ, honour it as somewhat sacred, and a sign of
Sanity in the diviner part; and this he illustrates from the practice of
Physitians, who in persons near death, do use Sternutatories, or such
medicines as provoke unto Sneezing; when if the faculty awaketh, and
Sternutation ensueth, they conceive hopes of life, and with gratulation
receive the signs of safety. <span class="sidenote"><i>In what cases a sign of good.</i></span> And so
is it also of good signality, according to that of <i>Hippocrates</i>, that
Sneezing cureth the hicket, and is profitable unto Women in hard labour;
and so is it good in Lethargies, Apoplexies, Catalepsies, and Coma&rsquo;s
<span class="sidenote15"><i>2. King 4. 35.</i></span>. <span class="sidenote"><i>In what of bad.</i></span> And in this natural way
it is sometime likewise of bad effects or signs, and may give hints of
deprecation; as in diseases of the chest; for therein <i>Hippocrates</i>
condemneth it as too much exagitating: in the beginning of <i>Catarrhs</i>
according unto <i>Avicenna</i>, as hindering concoction, in new and tender
conceptions (as <i>Pliny</i> observeth) for then it endangers abortion.</p>

<p>The second way was superstitious and Augurial, as <i>C√¶lius Rhodiginus</i>
hath illustrated in testimonies, as ancient as <i>Theocritus</i> and <i>Homer</i>:
as appears from the <i>Athenian</i> Master, who would have retired, because a
Boat-man Sneezed; and the testimony of <i>Austin</i>, that the Ancients were
wont to go to bed again if they Sneezed while they put on their shoe.
And in this way it was also of good and bad signification; so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
<i>Aristotle</i> hath a Problem, why Sneezing from noon unto midnight was
good, but from night to noon unlucky? So <i>Eustathius</i> upon <i>Homer</i>
observes, that Sneezing to the left hand was unlucky, but prosperous
unto the right; so, as <i>Plutarch</i> relateth, when <i>Themistocles</i>
sacrificed in his galley before the battle of <i>Xerxes</i>, and one of the
assistants upon the right hand sneezed; <i>Euphrantides</i> the Southsayer,
presaged the victory of the <i>Greeks</i>, and the overthrow of the
<i>Persians</i>.</p>

<p>Thus we may perceive the custom is more ancient then commonly conceived;
and these opinions hereof in all ages, not any one disease to have been
the occasion of this salute and deprecation. Arising at first from this
vehement and affrighting motion of the brain, inevitably observable unto
the standers by; from whence some finding dependent effects to ensue;
others ascribing hereto as a cause what perhaps but casually or
inconnexedly succeeded; they might proceed unto forms of speeches,
felicitating the good, or deprecating the evil to follow.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X_PE_IV" id="CHAPTER_X_PE_IV">CHAPTER X</a>
<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of the Jews.</span></h2>


<p>That <i>Jews</i> stink naturally, that is, that in their race and nation
there is an evil savour, is a received opinion we know not how to admit;
although concede many questionable points, and dispute not the verity of
sundry opinions which are of affinity hereto. We will acknowledg that
certain odours attend on animals, no less then certain colours; that
pleasant smels are not confined unto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span> vegetables, but found in divers
animals, and some more richly then in plants. And though the Problem of
<i>Aristotle</i> enquire why no animal smels sweet beside the Parde? yet
later discoveries add divers sorts of <i>Monkeys</i>, the <i>Civet Cat</i> and
<i>Gazela</i>, from which our Musk proceedeth. We confess that beside the
smell of the species, there may be individual odours, and every Man may
have a proper and peculiar savour; which although not perceptible unto
Man, who hath this sense, but weak, yet sensible unto <i>Dogs</i>, who hereby
can single out their masters in the dark. We will not deny that
particular Men have sent forth a pleasant savour, as <i>Theophrastus</i> and
<i>Plutarch</i> report of <i>Alexander</i> the great, and <i>Tzetzes</i> and <i>Cardan</i>
do testifie of themselves. That some may also emit an unsavory odour, we
have no reason to deny; for this may happen from the quality of what
they have taken; the F√¶tor whereof may discover it self by sweat and
urine, as being unmasterable by the natural heat of Man, not to be
dulcified by concoction beyond an unsavory condition: the like may come
to pass from putrid humours, as is often discoverable in putrid and
malignant feavers. And sometime also in gross and humid bodies even in
the latitude of sanity; the natural heat of the parts being insufficient
for a perfect and through digestion, and the errors of one concoction
not rectifiable by another. But that an unsavory odour is gentilitious
or national unto the <i>Jews</i>, if rightly understood, we cannot well
concede; nor will the information of <a name="CORR4" id="CORR4"><ins class="correction" title="original: reason or fence">reason or sence</ins></a> induce it.</p>

<p>For first, Upon consult of reason, there will be found no easie
assurance to fasten a material or temperamental propriety upon any
nation; there being scarce any condition (but what depends upon clime)
which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span> not exhausted or obscured from the commixture of introvenient
nations either by commerce or conquest; much more will it be difficult
to make out this affection in the <i>Jews</i>; whose race however pretended
to be pure, must needs have suffered inseparable commixtures with
nations of all sorts; not only in regard of their proselytes, but their
universal dispersion; some being posted from several parts of the earth,
others quite lost, and swallowed up in those nations where they planted.
For the tribes of <i>Reuben</i>, <i>Gad</i>, part of <i>Manasses</i> and <i>Naphthali</i>,
which were taken by <i>Assur</i>, and the rest at the Sacking of <i>Samaria</i>,
which were led away by <i>Salmanasser</i> into <i>Assyria</i>, and after a year
and half arrived at <i>Arsereth</i>, as is delivered in <i>Esdras</i>; these I say
never returned, and are by the <i>Jews</i> as vainly expected as their
<i>Messias</i>. Of those of the tribe of <i>Judah</i> and <i>Benjamin</i>, which were
led captive into <i>Babylon</i> by <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>, many returned under
<i>Zorobabel</i>; the rest remained, and from thence long after upon invasion
of the <i>Saracens</i>, fled as far as <i>India</i>; where yet they are said to
remain, but with little difference from the <i>Gentiles</i>.</p>

<p>The Tribes that returned to <i>Judea</i>, were afterward widely dispersed;
for beside sixteen thousand which <i>Titus</i> sent to <i>Rome</i> unto the
triumph of his father <i>Vespasian</i>, he sold no less then an hundred
thousand for slaves. Not many years after, <i>Adrian</i> the Emperour, who
ruined the whole Countrey, transplanted many thousands into <i>Spain</i>,
from whence they dispersed into divers Countreys, as into <i>France</i> and
<i>England</i>, but were banished after from both. From <i>Spain</i> they
dispersed into <i>Africa</i>, <i>Italy</i>, <i>Constantinople</i>, and the Dominions of
the <i>Turk</i>, where they remain as yet in very great numbers. And if
(according to good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span> relations) where they may freely speak it, they
forbear not to boast that there are at present many thousand <i>Jews</i> in
<i>Spane</i>, <i>France</i> and <i>England</i>, and some dispensed withall even to the
degree of Priesthood; it is a matter very considerable, and could they
be smelled out, would much advantage, not only the Church of Christ, but
also the coffers of Princes.</p>

<p>Now having thus lived in several Countries, and alwaies in subjection,
they must needs have suffered many commixtures; and we are sure they are
not exempted from the common contagion of Venery contracted first from
Christians. Nor as fornications unfrequent between them both; there
commonly passing opinions of invitement, that their Women desire
copulation with them rather then their own Nation, and affect Christian
carnality above circumcised venery. It being therefore acknowledged,
that some are lost, evident that others are mixed, and not assured that
any are distinct, it will be hard to establish this quality upon the
<i>Jews</i>, unless we also transfer the same unto those whose generations
are mixed, whose genealogies are <i>Jewish</i>, and naturally derived from
them.</p>

<p>Again, if we concede a National unsavouriness in any people, yet shall
we find the <i>Jews</i> less subject hereto then any, and that in those
regards which most powerfully concur to such effects, that is, their
diet and generation. <span class="sidenote"><i>The Jews generally very temperate.</i></span> As for
their diet whether in obedience unto the precepts of reason, or the
injunctions of parsimony, therein they are very temperate; seldom
offending in ebriety or excess of drink, nor erring in gulosity or
superfluity of meats; whereby they prevent indigestion and crudities,
and consequently putrescence of humors. They have in abomination all
flesh maimed, or the inwards any way vitiated; and therefore eat no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
meat but of their own killing. They observe not only fasts at certain
times, but are restrained unto very few dishes at all times; so few,
that whereas St. <i>Peters</i> sheet will hardly cover our Tables, their Law
doth scarce permit them to set forth a Lordly feast; nor any way to
answer the luxury of our times, or those of our fore-fathers. For of
flesh their Law restrains them many sorts, and such as compleat our
feasts: That Animal, <i>Propter convivia natum</i> <span class="sidenote">Quanta est gula, qu√¶
sibi totos ponit Apros! Animal propter convivia natum.</span>, they touch not,
nor any of its preparations, or parts so much in respect at <i>Roman</i>
Tables, nor admit they unto their board, <i>Hares</i>, <i>Conies</i>, <i>Herons</i>,
<i>Plovers</i> or <i>Swans</i>. Of <i>Fishes</i> they only taste of such as have both
fins and scales; which are comparatively but few in number, such only,
saith <i>Aristotle</i>, whose Egg or spawn is arenaceous; whereby are
excluded all cetaceous and cartilagious <i>Fishes</i>; many pectinal, whose
ribs are rectilineal; many costal, which have their ribs embowed; all
spinal, or such as have no ribs, but only a back bone, or somewhat
analogous thereto, as <i>Eels</i>, <i>Congers</i>, <i>Lampries</i>; all that are
testaceous, as <i>Oysters</i>, <i>Cocles</i>, <i>Wilks</i>, <i>Scollops</i>, <i>Muscles</i>; and
likewise all crustaceous, as <i>Crabs</i>, <i>Shrimps</i> and <i>Lobsters</i>. So that
observing a spare and simple diet, whereby they prevent the generation
of crudities; and fasting often whereby they might also digest them;
they must be less inclinable unto this infirmity then any other Nation,
whose proceedings are not so reasonable to avoid it.</p>

<p>As for their generations and conceptions (which are the purer from good
diet,) they become more pure and perfect by the strict observation of
their Law; upon the injunctions whereof, they severely observe the times
of Purification, and avoid all copulation, either in the uncleanness of
themselves, or impurity of their Women.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span> A Rule, I fear, not so well
observed by Christians; whereby not only conceptions are prevented, but
if they proceed, so vitiated and defiled, that durable inquinations
remain upon the birth. <span class="sidenote"><i>The original or material causes of the Pox
and Meazels.</i></span> Which, when the conception meets with these impurities,
must needs be very potent; since in the purest and most fair
conceptions, learned Men derive the cause of <i>Pox</i> and <i>Meazels</i>, from
principles of that nature; that is, the menstrous impurities in the
Mothers blood, and virulent tinctures contracted by the Infant, in the
nutriment of the womb.</p>

<p>Lastly, Experience will convict it; for this offensive odor is no way
discoverable in their Synagogues where many are, and by reason of their
number could not be concealed: nor is the same discernable in commerce
or conversation with such as are cleanly in Apparel, and decent in their
Houses. Surely the Viziars and <i>Turkish</i> Basha&rsquo;s are not of this
opinion; who as Sir <i>Henry Blunt</i> informeth, do generally keep a <i>Jew</i>
of their private Counsel. And were this true, the <i>Jews</i> themselves do
not strictly make out the intention of their Law, for in vain do they
scruple to approach the dead, who livingly are cadaverous, or fear any
outward pollution, whose temper pollutes themselves. And lastly, were
this true, yet our opinion is not impartial; for unto converted <i>Jews</i>
who are of the same seed, no Man imputeth this unsavoury odor; as though
Aromatized by their conversion, they lost their scent with their
Religion, and smelt no longer then they savoured of the <i>Jew</i>.</p>

<p>Now the ground that begat or propagated this assertion, might be the
distasteful aversness of the Christian from the <i>Jew</i>, upon the villany
of that fact, which made them abominable and stink in the nostrils<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span> of
all Men. Which real practise, and metaphorical expression, did after
proceed into a literal construction; but was a fraudulent illation; for
such an evil savour their father <i>Jacob</i> acknowledged in himself
<span class="sidenote10">Gen. 34.</span>, when he said, his sons had made him stink in the land, that
is, to be abominable unto the inhabitants thereof. Now how dangerous it
is in sensible things to use metaphorical expressions unto the people,
and what absurd conceits they will swallow in their literals; an
impatient example we have in our profession; who having called an eaten
<i>ulcer</i> by the name of a <i>Wolf</i>, common apprehension conceives a reality
therein; and against our selves, ocular affirmations are pretended to
confirm it.</p>

<p>The nastiness of that Nation, and sluttish course of life hath much
promoted the opinion, occasioned by their servile condition at first,
and inferiour ways of parsimony ever since; as is delivered by Mr.
<i>Sandys</i>. They are generally fat, saith he, and rank of the savours
which attend upon sluttish corpulency. The <i>Epithetes</i> assigned them by
ancient times, have also advanced the same; for <i>Ammianus Marcellinus</i>
describeth them in such language; and <i>Martial</i> more ancient, in such a
relative expression sets forth unsavoury <i>Bassa</i>.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="line indent2"><i>Quod jejunia Sabbatoriorum.</i></div>
<div class="line"><i>Mallem, quam quod oles, olere Bassa.</i></div>
</div></div>

<p>From whence notwithstanding we cannot infer an inward imperfection in
the temper of that Nation; it being but an effect in the breath from
outward observation, in their strict and tedious fasting; and was a
common effect in the breaths of other Nations, became a Proverb
<span class="sidenote">ŒùŒ∑œÉœÑŒµŒØŒ±œÇ ·ΩÑŒ∂ŒµŒπŒΩ. Iejunia olere.</span> among the <i>Greeks</i>, and the
reason thereof begot a Problem in <i>Aristotle</i>.</p>

<p>Lastly, If all were true, and were this savour con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>ceded, yet are the
reasons alleadged for it no way satisfactory. <i>Hucherius</i>,
<span class="sidenote"> De sterilitate</span> and after him <i>Alsarius Crucius</i>,<span class="sidenote">Cruc. Med. Epist.</span>
imputes this effect unto their abstinence from salt or salt meats; which
how to make good in the present diet of the <i>Jews</i>, we know not; nor
shall we conceive it was observed of old, if we consider they seasoned
every Sacrifice, and all oblations whatsoever; whereof we cannot deny a
great part was eaten by the Priests. And if the offering were of flesh,
it was salted no less than thrice, that is, once in the common chamber
of salt, at the foot-step of the Altar, and upon the top thereof, as is
at large delivered by <i>Maimonides</i>. Nor if they refrained all salt, is
the illation very urgent; for many there are, not noted for ill odours,
which eat no salt at all; as all carnivorous Animals, most Children,
many whole Nations, and probably our Fathers after the Creation; there
being indeed in every thing we eat, a natural and concealed salt, which
is separated by digestions, as doth appear in our tears, sweat and
urines, although we refrain all salt, or what doth seem to contain it.</p>

<p>Another cause is urged by <i>Campegius</i>, and much received by Christians;
that this ill savour is a curse derived upon them by Christ, and stands,
as a badge or brand of a generation that crucified their <i>Salvator</i>. But
this is a conceit without all warrant; and an easie way to take off
dispute in what point of obscurity soever. A method of many Writers,
which much depreciates the esteem and value of miracles; that is,
therewith to salve not only real verities, but also nonexistencies. Thus
have elder times not only ascribed the immunity of <i>Ireland</i> from any
venemous beast, unto the staff or rod of <i>Patrick</i>; but the long tails
of <i>Kent</i>, unto the malediction of <i>Austin</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span> Thus therefore, although
we concede that many opinions are true which hold some conformity unto
this, yet in assenting hereto, many difficulties must arise: it being a
dangerous point to annex a constant property unto any Nation, and much
more this unto the <i>Jew</i>; since this quality is not verifiable by
observation; since the grounds are feeble that should establish it; and
lastly, since if all were true, yet are the reasons alleadged for it, of
no sufficiency to maintain it.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI_PE_IV" id="CHAPTER_XI_PE_IV">CHAPTER XI</a>
<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of Pigmies.</span></h2>


<p>By <i>Pigmies</i> we understand a dwarfish race of people, or lowest
diminution of mankind, comprehended in one cubit, or as some will have
it, in two foot or three spans; not taking them single, but nationally
considering them, and as they make up an aggregated habitation. Whereof
although affirmations be many, and testimonies more frequent then in any
other point which wise men have cast into the list of fables, yet that
there is, or ever was such a race or Nation, upon exact and confirmed
testimonies, our strictest enquiry receives no satisfaction.</p>

<p>I say, exact testimonies, first, In regard of the Authors, from whom we
derive the account, for though we meet herewith in <i>Herodotus</i>,
<i>Philostratus</i>, <i>Mela</i>, <i>Pliny</i>, <i>Solinus</i>, and many more; yet were they
derivative Relators, and the primitive Author was <i>Homer</i>; who, using
often similies, as well to delight the ear, as to illustrate his matter,
in the third of his Iliads, compareth the <i>Trojans</i> unto <i>Cranes</i>, when
they descend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span> against the <i>Pigmies</i>; which was more largely set out by
<i>Oppian</i>, <i>Juvenal</i>, <i>Mantuan</i>, and many Poets since, and being only a
pleasant figment in the fountain, became a solemn story in the stream,
and current still among us.</p>

<p>Again, Many professed enquirers have rejected it; <i>Strabo</i> an exact and
judicious Geographer, hath largely condemned it as a fabulous story,
<i>Julius Scaliger</i> a diligent enquirer, accounts thereof, but as a
Poetical fiction; <i>Ulysses Aldrovandus</i> a most exact Zoographer in an
express discourse hereon, concludes the story fabulous, and a Poetical
account of <i>Homer</i>; and the same was formerly conceived by <i>Eustathius</i>,
his excellent Commentator. <i>Albertus Magnus</i> a man ofttimes too
credulous, herein was more then dubious; for he affirmeth, if any such
dwarfs were ever extant, they were surely some kind of <i>Apes</i>: which is
a conceit allowed by <i>Cardan</i>, and not esteemed improbable by many
others.</p>

<p>There are I confess two testimonies, which from their authority admit of
consideration. The first of <i>Aristotle</i>,<span class="sidenote"><i>Hist. animal. lib. 3.</i></span>
whose words are these, ·ºêœÉœÑ·Ω∂ d·Ω≤ ·ΩÅ œÑœåœÄŒøœÇ, etc. That is, <i>Hic locus est
quem incolunt Pygm√¶i, non enim id fabula est, sed pusillum genus ut
aiunt.</i> Wherein indeed <i>Aristotle</i> plaies the <i>Aristotle</i>, that is, the
wary and evading assertor; For though with <i>non est fabula</i>, he seems at
first to confirm it, yet at the last he claps in <i>Sciunt aiunt</i>, and
shakes the belief he put before upon it. And therefore I observe
<i>Scaliger</i> hath not translated the first; perhaps supposing it
surreptitious or unworthy so great an assertor. And truly for those
books of animals, or work of eight hundred talents, as <i>Athen√¶us</i> terms
it, although ever to be admired, as containing most excellent truths;
yet are many things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span> therein delivered upon relation, and some repugnant
unto the history of our senses; as we are able to make out in some, and
<i>Scaliger</i> hath observed in many more, as he hath freely declared in his
Comment upon that piece.</p>

<p>The second testimony is deduced from holy Scripture;<span class="sidenote"> Ezek. 27. 12.</span>
thus rendered in the vulgar translation, <i>Sed et Pygm√¶i qui erant in
turribus tuis, pharetras suas suspenderunt in muris tuis per gyrum</i>:
from whence notwithstanding we cannot infer this assertion, for first
the Translators accord not, and the Hebrew word <i>Gammadim</i> is very
variously rendered. Though <i>Aquila</i>, <i>Vetablus</i> and <i>Lyra</i> will have it
<i>Pygm√¶i</i>, yet in the Septuagint, it is no more then Watchmen; and so in
the <i>Arabick</i> and high <i>Dutch</i>. In the <i>Chalde</i>, <i>Cappadocians</i>, in
<i>Symmachus</i>, <i>Medes</i>, and in the <i>French</i>, those of <i>Gamad</i>.
<i>Theodotian</i> of old, and <i>Tremellius</i> of late, have retained the
Textuary word; and so have the <i>Italian</i>, Low <i>Dutch</i> and <i>English</i>
Translators, that is, the Men of <i>Arvad</i> were upon thy walls round
about, and the <i>Gammadims</i> were in thy Towers.</p>

<p>Nor do men only dissent in the Translation of the word, but in the
Exposition of the sense and meaning thereof; for some by <i>Gammadims</i>
understand a people of <i>Syria</i>, so called from the City <i>Gamala</i>; some
hereby understand the <i>Cappadocians</i>, many the <i>Medes</i> <span class="sidenote"><i>See Mr.</i>
Fullers <i>excellent description of</i> Palestine.</span>: and hereof <i>Forerius</i>
hath a singular Exposition, conceiving the Watchmen of <i>Tyre</i> might well
be called <i>Pigmies</i>, the Towers of that City being so high, that unto
Men below, they appeared in a cubital stature. Others expounded it quite
contrary to common acception, that is not Men of the least, but of the
largest size; so doth <i>Cornelius</i> construe <i>Pygm√¶i</i>, or <i>viri
cubitales</i>, that is, not Men of a cubit high, but of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span> largest
stature, whose height like that of Giants, is rather to be taken by the
cubit then the foot; in which phrase we read the measure of <i>Goliah</i>,
whose height is said to be six cubits and a span. Of affinity hereto is
also the Exposition of <i>Jerom</i>; not taking <i>Pigmies</i> for dwarfs, but
stout and valiant Champions; not taking the sense of œÄœÖŒ≥Œº·Ω¥, which
signifies the cubit measure, but that which expresseth Pugils; that is,
Men fit for combat and the exercise of the fist. Thus can there be no
satisfying illation from this Text, the diversity or rather contrariety
of Expositions and interpretations, distracting more then confirming the
truth of the story.</p>

<p>Again, I say, exact testimonies; in reference unto circumstantial
relations so diversly or contrarily delivered. Thus the Relation of
<i>Aristotle</i> placeth them above <i>Egypt</i> towards the head of <i>Nyle</i> in
<i>Africa</i>; <i>Philostratus</i> affirms they are about <i>Ganges</i> in <i>Asia</i>, and
<i>Pliny</i> in a third place, that is, <i>Gerania</i> in <i>Scythia</i>: some write
they fight with Cranes, but <i>Menecles</i> in <i>Athen√¶us</i> affirms they fight
with <i>Partridges</i>, some say they ride on <i>Partridges</i>, and some on the
backs of <i>Rams</i>.</p>

<p>Lastly, I say, confirmed testimonies; for though <i>Paulus Jovius</i>
delivers there are <i>Pigmies</i> beyond <i>Japan</i>; <i>Pigafeta</i>, about the
<i>Molucca&rsquo;s</i>; and <i>Olaus Magnus</i> placeth them in <i>Greenland</i>; yet wanting
frequent confirmation in a matter so confirmable, their affirmation
carrieth but slow perswasion;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and wise men may think there is as much
reality in the <a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a><i>Pigmies</i> of <i>Paracelsus</i>; that is, his non-Adamical
men, or middle natures betwixt men and spirits.</p>

<p>There being thus no sufficient confirmation of their verity, some doubt
may arise concerning their possibility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>, wherein, since it is not
defined in what dimensions the soul may exercise her faculties, we shall
not conclude impossibility; or that there might not be a race of
<i>Pigmies</i>, as there is sometimes of Giants. So may we take in the
opinion of <i>Austin</i>, and his Comment <i>Ludovicus</i>, but to believe they
should be in the stature of a foot or span, requires the preaspection of
such a one as <i>Philetas</i> the Poet in <i>Athen√¶us</i>: who was fain to fasten
lead unto his feet lest the wind should blow him away. Or that other in
the same Author, who was so little <i>ut ad obolum accederet</i>; a story so
strange, that we might herein excuse the PRINTER, did not the account of
<i>√Ülian</i> accord unto it, as <i>Causabone</i> hath observed in his learned
Animadversions.</p>

<p>Lastly, If any such Nation there were, yet is it ridiculous what Men
have delivered of them; that they fight with <i>Cranes</i> upon the backs of
<i>Rams</i> or <i>Partridges</i>: or what is delivered by <i>Ctesias</i>, that they are
<i>Negroes</i> in the middest of <i>India</i>; whereof the King of that Country
entertaineth three thousand Archers for his guard. Which is a relation
below the tale of <i>Oberon</i>; nor could they better defend him, then the
Emblem saith, they offended <i>Hercules</i> whilest he slept; that is, to
wound him no deeper, then to awake him.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII_PE_IV" id="CHAPTER_XII_PE_IV">CHAPTER XII</a>
<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of the great Climacterical year, that is,
Sixty three.</span></h2>


<p>Certainly the Eyes of the understanding, and those of the sense are
differently deceived in their greatest objects; the sense apprehending
them in lesser magnitudes then their dimensions require; so it beholdeth
the Sun, the Stars, and the Earth it self. But the understanding quite
otherwise: for that ascribeth unto many things far larger horizons then
their due circumscriptions require: and receiveth them with
amplifications which their reality will not admit. Thus hath it fared
with many Heroes and most worthy persons, who being sufficiently
commendable from true and unquestionable merits, have received
advancement from falshood and the fruitful stock of Fables. Thus hath it
happened unto the Stars, and Luminaries of heaven: who being
sufficiently admirable in themselves, have been set out by effects, no
way dependent on their efficiencies, and advanced by amplifications to
the questioning of their true endowments. Thus is it not improbable it
hath also fared with number, which though wonderful in it self, and
sufficiently magnifiable from its demonstrable affections, hath yet
received adjections from the multiplying conceits of men, and stands
laden with additions, which its equity will not admit.</p>

<p>And so perhaps hath it happened unto the number, 7 and 9, which
multiplied into themselves do make up Sixty three, commonly esteemed the
great Climacterical of our lives. For the daies of men are usually cast
up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span> by Septenaries, and every seventh year conceived to carry some
altering character with it, either in the temper of body, mind, or both.
But among all other, three are most remarkable, that is, 7 times 7 or
fourty nine, 9 times 9 or eighty one, and 7 times 9 or the year of Sixty
three; which is conceived to carry with it the most considerable
fatality; and consisting of both the other numbers was apprehended to
comprise the vertue of either: is therefore expected and entertained
with fear, and esteemed a favour of fate to pass it over. <span class="sidenote"><i>The
great Climacterical, Sixty-three, no such dangerous year.</i></span> Which
notwithstanding many suspect to be but a Panick terrour, and men to fear
they justly know not what: and to speak indifferently, I find no
satisfaction: nor any sufficiency in the received grounds to establish a
rational fear.</p>

<p>Now herein to omit Astrological considerations (which are but rarely
introduced) the popular foundation whereby it hath continued, is first,
the extraordinary power and secret virtue conceived to attend these
numbers: whereof we must confess there have not wanted not only especial
commendations, but very singular conceptions. Among Philosophers,
<i>Pythagoras</i> seems to have played the leading part; which was long after
continued by his disciples, and the <i>Italick</i> School. The Philosophy of
<i>Plato</i>, and most of the <i>Platonists</i> abounds in numeral considerations:
above all, <i>Philo</i> the learned <i>Jew</i>, hath acted this part even to
superstition; bestowing divers pages in summing up every thing, which
might advantage this number. Which notwithstanding, when a serious
Reader shall perpend, he will hardly find any thing that may convince
his judgment, or any further perswade, then the lenity of his belief, or
prejudgment of reason inclineth.</p>

<p>For first, Not only the number of 7 and 9 from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span> considerations abstruse,
have been extolled by most, but all or most of the other digits have
been as mystically applauded. For the number of One and Three have not
been only admired by the Heathens, but from adorable grounds, the unity
of God, and mystery of the Trinity admired by many Christians. The
number of four stands much admired, not only in the quaternity of the
Elements, which are the principles of bodies, but in the letters of the
Name of God, which in the <i>Greek</i>, <i>Arabian</i>, <i>Persian</i>, <i>Hebrew</i>, and
<i>Egyptian</i>, consisteth of that number; and was so venerable among the
<i>Pythagoreans</i>, that they swore by the number four. That of six hath
found many leaves in its favour; not only for the daies of the Creation,
but its natural consideration, as being a perfect number, and the first
that is compleated by its parts; that is, the sixt, the half, and the
third, 1. 2. 3. Which drawn into a sum, make six. The number of Ten hath
been as highly extolled, as containing even, odd, long, plain, quadrate
and cubical numbers; and <i>Aristotle</i> observed with admiration, that
<i>Barbarians</i> as well as <i>Greeks</i>, did use numeration unto Ten, which
being so general, was not to be judged casual, but to have a foundation
in nature. So that not only 7 and 9, but all the rest have had their
Elogies, as may be observed at large in <i>Rhodiginus</i>, and in several
Writers since: every one extolling number, according to his subject, and
as it advantaged the present discourse in hand.</p>

<p>Again, They have been commended not only from pretended grounds in
nature, but from artificial, casual or fabulous foundations: so have
some endeavoured to advance their admiration, from the 9 Muses, from the
7 Wonders of the World, from the 7 Gates of <i>Thebes</i>:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span> in that 7 Cities
contended for <i>Homer</i>, in that there are 7 Stars in <i>Ursa minor</i>, and 7
in Charles wayn, or Plaustrum of <i>Ursa major</i>. Wherein indeed although
the ground be natural, yet either from constellations or their
remarkable parts, there is the like occasion to commend any other
number, the number 5 from the stars in <i>Sagitta</i>, 3 from the girdle of
<i>Orion</i>, and 4 from <i>Equiculus</i>, <i>Crusero</i>, or the feet of the Centaur:
yet are such as these clapt in by very good Authors, and some not
omitted by <i>Philo</i>.</p>

<p>Nor are they only extolled from Arbitrary and Poetical grounds, but from
foundations and principles, false or dubious. That Women are menstruant,
and Men pubescent at the year of twice seven is accounted a punctual
truth; which period nevertheless we dare not precisely determine, as
having observed a variation and latitude in most, agreeable unto the
heat of clime or temper; Men arising variously unto virility, according
to the activity of causes that promote it. <i>Sanguis menstruosus ad diem,
ut plurimum, septimum durat</i>, saith <i>Philo</i>. Which notwithstanding is
repugnant unto experience, and the doctrine of <i>Hippocrates</i>, who in his
book, <i>de di√¶ta</i>, plainly affirmeth, it is thus but with few women, and
only such as abound with pituitous and watery humours.</p>

<p>It is further conceived to receive addition, in that there are 7 heads
of <i>Nyle</i>, but we have made manifest elsewhere, that by the description
of Geographers, they have been sometime more, and are at present fewer.</p>

<p>In that there were 7 Wise men of <i>Greece</i>, which though generally
received, yet having enquired into the verity thereof we cannot so
readily determine it, for in the life of <i>Thales</i>, who was accounted in
that number, <i>Diogenes Laertius</i> plainly saith, <i>Magna de</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span> <i>eorum numero
discordia est</i>; some holding but four, some ten, others twelve, and none
agreeth in their names, though according in their number.</p>

<p>In that there are just 7 Planets or errant Stars in the lower orbs of
Heaven, but it is now demonstrable unto sense, that there are many more;
as <i>Galileo</i><span class="sidenote">Nuncius Sydereus.</span> hath declared, that is, two more in
the orb of Saturn, and no less then four more in the sphere of Jupiter.
And the like may be said of the <i>Pleiades</i> or 7 Stars, which are also
introduced to magnifie this number, for whereas scarce discerning six,
we account them 7, by his relation, there are no less then fourty.</p>

<p>That the Heavens are encompassed with 7 Circles, is also the allegation
of <i>Philo</i>; which are in his account, the Arctick, Antarctick, the
Summer and Winter Tropicks, the √Üquator, Zodiack, and the Milky circle;
whereas by Astronomers they are received in greater number. For though
we leave out the Lacteous circle (which <i>Aratus</i>, <i>Geminus</i>, and
<i>Proclus</i>, out of him hath numbred among the rest) yet are there more by
four then <i>Philo</i> mentions; that is, the Horizon, Meridian and both the
Colures; circles very considerable, and generally delivered, not only by
<i>Ptolomie</i>, and the Astronomers since his time, but such as flourished
long before, as <i>Hipparchus</i> and <i>Eudoxus</i>. So that for ought I know, if
it make for our purpose, or advance the theme in hand, with equal
liberty, we may affirm there were 7 Sybils, or but 7 signs in the
Zodiack circle of Heaven.</p>

<p>That verse in <i>Virgil</i> translated out of <i>Homer</i> <span class="sidenote">Œ§œÅ·Ω∂œÇ
ŒºŒ¨Œ∫Œ±œÅŒµœÇ ŒîŒ±ŒΩŒ±Œø·Ω∂ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ œÑŒµœÑœÅŒ¨œáŒπœÇ.</span>, <i>O terque quaterque beati</i>; that is as
men will have it, 7 times happy, hath much advanced this number in
critical apprehensions; yet is not this construction so indubitably to
be received, as not at all to be ques<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>tioned: for though <i>Rhodiginus</i>,
<i>Beroaldus</i>, and others from the authority of <i>Macrobius</i> so interpret
it, yet <i>Servius</i> his ancient commentator conceives no more thereby then
a finite number for indefinite, and that no more is implied then often
happy. <i>Strabo</i><span class="sidenote10">Lib. 10.</span> the ancientest of them all, conceives no
more by this in <i>Homer</i>, then a full and excessive expression; whereas
in common phrase and received language, he should have termed them
thrice happy; herein exceeding that number, he called them four times
happy, that is, more then thrice. And this he illustrates by the like
expression of <i>Homer</i>, in the speech of <i>Circe</i>; who to express the
dread and terrour of the Ocean, sticks not unto the common form of
speech in the strict account of its reciprocations, but largely
speaking, saith, it ebbs and flows no less then thrice a day, <i>terque
die revomit fluctus iterumque resorbet</i>. And so when it is said by
<i>Horace</i>, <i>f√¶lices ter et amplius</i>, the exposition is sufficient, if we
conceive no more then the letter fairly beareth, that is, four times, or
indefinitely more then thrice.</p>

<p>But the main considerations which most set of this number, are
observations drawn from the motions of the Moon, supposed to be measured
by sevens; and the critical or decretory daies dependent on that number.
As for the motion of the Moon, though we grant it to be measured by
sevens, yet will not this advance the same before its fellow numbers;
for hereby the motion of other Stars are not measured, the fixed Stars
by many thousand years, the Sun by 365 daies, the superiour Planets by
more, the inferiour by somewhat less. And if we consider the revolution
of the first Movable, and the daily motion from East to West, common
unto all the Orbs, we shall find it measured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span> by another number, for
being performed in four and twenty hours, it is made up of 4 times 6:
and this is the measure and standard of other parts of time, of months,
of years, Olympiades, Lustres, Indictions of Cycles, Jubilies, etc.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>What a Solary month is.</i></div>

<p>Again, Months are not only Lunary, and measured by the Moon, but also
Solary, and determined by the motion of the Sun; that is, the space
wherein the Sun doth pass 30 degrees of the Ecliptick. By this month
<i>Hippocrates</i><span class="sidenote">De octomestri partu.</span> computed the time of the
Infants gestation in the womb; for 9 times 30, that is, 270 daies, or
compleat 9 months, make up forty weeks, the common compute of women. And
this is to be understood, when he saith, 2 daies makes the fifteenth,
and 3 the tenth part of a mouth. This was the month of the ancient
<i>Hebrews</i> before their departure out of <i>Egypt</i>: and hereby the compute
will fall out right, and the account concur, when in one place it is
said, the waters of the flood prevailed an hundred and fifty daies, and
in another it is delivered, that they prevailed from the seventeenth day
of the second month, unto the seventeenth day of the seventh. As for
hebdomadal periods or weeks, although in regard of their Sabbaths, they
were observed by the <i>Hebrews</i>, yet it is not apparent the ancient
<i>Greeks</i> or <i>Romans</i> used any: but had another division of their months
into Ides, Nones and Calends.</p>

<p>Moreover, Moneths howsoever taken, are not exactly divisible into
septenaries or weeks, which fully contain seven daies: whereof four
times do make compleatly twenty eight. For, beside the usual or
Calendary month, there are but four considerable: the month of
Peragration, of Apparition, of Consecution, and the medical or
Decretorial month; whereof some come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span> short, others exceed this account.
A month of Peragration, is the time of the Moons revolution from any
part of the Zodiack, unto the same again; and this containeth but 27
daies, and about 8 hours: which cometh short to compleat the septenary
account. The month of Consecution, or as some will term it, of
progression, is the space between one conjunction of the Moon with the
Sun, unto another: and this containeth 29 daies and an half: for the
Moon returning unto the same point wherein it was kindled by the Sun,
and not finding it there again (for in the mean time, by its proper
motion it hath passed through 2 signs) it followeth after, and attains
the Sun in the space of 2 daies and 4 hours more, which added unto the
account of Peragration, makes 29 daies and an half: so that this month
exceedeth the latitude of Septenaries, and the fourth part comprehendeth
more then 7 daies. A month of Apparition, is the space wherein the Moon
appeareth (deducting three daies wherein it commonly disappeareth; and
being in combustion with the Sun, is presumed of less activity,) and
this containeth but 26 daies and 12 hours. The medical month, not much
exceedeth this, consisting of 26 daies and 22 hours, and is made up out
of all the other months. For if out of 29 and an half, the month of
Consecution, we deduct 3 daies of disappearance, there will remain the
month of Apparition 26 daies and 12 hours: whereto if we add 27 daies
and 8 hours, the month of Peragration, there will arise 53 daies and 10
hours, which divided by 2, makes 26 daies and 22 hours: called by
Physitians the medical month: introduced by <i>Galen</i> against
<i>Archigenes</i>, for the better compute of Decretory or Critical daies.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>What a Critical day is.</i></div>

<p>As for the Critical daies (such I mean wherein upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span> a decertation
between the disease and nature, there ensueth a sensible alteration,
either to life or death,) the reasons thereof are rather deduced from
Astrology, then Arithmetick: for accounting from the beginning of the
disease, and reckoning on unto the seventh day, the Moon will be in a
Tetragonal or Quadrate aspect, that is, 4 signs removed from that
wherein the disease began: in the fourteenth day it will be in an
opposite aspect: and at the end of the third septenary, Tetragonal
again: as will most graphically appear in the figures of Astrologers,
especially <i>Lucas Gauricus</i>, <i>De diebus decretoriis</i>.</p>

<p>Again, (Beside that computing by the Medical month, the first hebdomade
or septenary consists of 6 daies, seventeen hours and an half, the
second happeneth in 13 daies and eleven hours, and the third but in the
twentieth natural day) what <i>Galen</i> first, and <i>Aben-Ezra</i> since
observed in his Tract of Critical daies, in regard of Eccentricity and
the Epicycle or lesser orb wherein it moveth, the motion of the Moon is
various and unequal; whereby the Critical account must also vary. For
though its middle motion be equal, and of 13 degrees, yet in the other
it moveth sometimes fifteen, sometimes less then twelve. For moving in
the upper part of its orb, it performeth its motion more slowly then in
the lower; insomuch that being at the height, it arriveth at the
Tetragonal and opposite signs sooner, and the Critical day will be in 6
and 13; and being at the lowest, the critical account will be out of the
latitude of 7, nor happen before the eighth or ninth day. Which are
considerations not to be neglected in the compute of decretory daies,
and manifestly declare that other numbers must have a respect herein as
well as 7 and fourteen.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>Lastly, Some things to this intent are deduced from holy Scripture; thus
is the year of <i>Jubile</i> introduced to magnifie this number, as being a
year made out of 7 times 7; wherein notwithstanding there may be a
misapprehension; for this ariseth not from 7 times 7, that is, 49; but
was observed the fiftieth year, as is expressed,<span class="sidenote10">Levit. 25.</span>, And
you shall hallow the fiftieth year, a <i>Jubile</i> shall that fiftieth year
be unto you. Answerable whereto is the Exposition of the <i>Jews</i>
themselves, as is delivered by <i>Ben-Maimon</i>; that is, the year of
<i>Jubile</i>, cometh not into the account of the years of 7, but the fourty
ninth is the Release, and the fiftieth the year of <i>Jubile</i>. Thus is it
also esteemed no small advancement unto this number, that the Genealogy
of our Saviour is summed up by 14, that is, this number doubled;
according as is expressed<span class="sidenote10">Mat. 1.</span>. So all the generations from
<i>Abraham</i> to <i>David</i> are fourteen generations, and from <i>David</i> unto the
carrying away into <i>Babylon</i>, are fourteen generations; and from the
carrying away into <i>Babylon</i> unto <i>Christ</i>, are fourteen generations.
Which nevertheless must not be strictly understood as numeral relations
require; for from <i>David</i> unto <i>Jeconiah</i> are accounted by <i>Matthew</i> but
14 generations; whereas according to the exact account in the History of
Kings, there were at least 17; and 3 in this account, that is,
<i>Ahazias</i>, <i>Joas</i> and <i>Amazias</i> are left out. For so it is delivered by
the Evangelist: And <i>Joram</i> begat <i>Ozias</i>: whereas in the regal
Genealogy there are 3 successions between: for <i>Ozias</i> or <i>Uzziah</i> was
the son of <i>Amazias</i>, <i>Amazias</i> of <i>Joas</i>, <i>Joas</i> of <i>Azariah</i>, and
<i>Azariah</i> of <i>Joram</i>: so that in strict account, <i>Joram</i> was the
<i>Abavus</i> or Grand-father twice removed, and not the Father of <i>Ozias</i>.
And these second omitted descents made a very considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span> measure of
time, in the Royal chronology of <i>Judah</i>: for though <i>Azariah</i> reigned
but one year, yet <i>Joas</i> reigned fourty, and <i>Amazias</i> no less then nine
and twenty. However therefore these were delivered by the Evangelist,
and carry (no doubt) an incontroulable conformity unto the intention of
his delivery: yet are they not appliable unto precise numerality, nor
strictly to be drawn unto the rigid test of numbers.</p>

<p>Lastly, Though many things have been delivered by Authors concerning
number, and they transferred unto the advantage of their nature, yet are
they oft-times otherwise to be understood, then as they are vulgarly
received in active and causal considerations; they being many times
delivered Hieroglyphically, Metaphorically, Illustratively, and not with
reference unto action or causality. True it is, that God made all things
in number, weight and measure, yet nothing by them or through the
efficacy of either. Indeed our daies, actions and motions being measured
by time (which is but motion measured) what ever is observable in any,
falls under the account of some number; which notwithstanding cannot be
denominated the cause of those events. So do we injustly assign the
power of Action even unto Time it self; nor do they speak properly who
say that Time consumeth all things; for Time is not effective, nor are
bodies destroyed by it, but from the action and passion of their
Elements in it; whose account it only affordeth: and measuring out their
motion, informs us in the periods and terms of their duration, rather
then effecteth or physically produceth the same.</p>

<p>A second consideration which promoteth this opinion, are confirmations
drawn from Writers, who have made observations, or set down favourable
reasons for this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span> Climacterical year; so have <i>Henricus Ranzovius</i>,
<i>Baptista Codronchus</i>,<span class="sidenote">De annis Climactericis.</span> and <i>Levinus
Lemnius</i><span class="sidenote">De occultis natur√¶ miraculis.</span> much confirmed the same;
but above all, that memorable Letter of <i>Augustus</i> <span class="sidenote10">Bel. lib.
5.</span> sent unto his Nephew <i>Caius</i>, wherein he encourageth him to
celebrate his nativity, for he had now escaped Sixty three, the great
Climacterical and dangerous year unto man: which notwithstanding rightly
perpended, it can be no singularity to question it, nor any new Paradox
to deny it.</p>

<p>For first, It is implicitely, and upon consequence denied by <i>Aristotle</i>
in his Politicks, in that discourse against <i>Plato</i>, who measured the
vicissitude and mutation of States, by a periodical fatality of number.
<i>Ptolomie</i> that famous Mathematician plainly saith, he will not deliver
his doctrines by parts and numbers which are ineffectual, and have not
the nature of causes; now by these numbers saith <i>Rhodiginus</i> and
<i>Mirandula</i>, he implieth Climacterical years, that is, septenaries, and
novenaries set down by the bare observation of numbers. <i>Censorinus</i> an
Author of great authority, and sufficient antiquity, speaks yet more
amply in his book <i>De die Natali</i>, wherein expresly treating of
Climacterical daies, he thus delivereth himself. Some maintain that 7
times 7, that is, fourty nine, is most dangerous of any other, and this
is the most general opinion; others unto 7 times 7, add 9 times 9, that
is, the year of eighty one, both which consisting of square and quadrate
numbers, were thought by <i>Plato</i> and others to be of great
consideration; as for this year of Sixty three or 7 times 9, though some
esteem it of most danger, yet do I conceive it less dangerous then the
other; for though it containeth both numbers above named, that is, 7 and
9, yet neither of them square or quadrate; and as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span> is different from
them both, so is it not potent in either. Nor is this year remarkable in
the death of many famous men. I find indeed that <i>Aristotle</i> died this
year, but he by the vigour of his mind, a long time sustained a natural
infirmity of stomack; so that it was a greater wonder he attained unto
Sixty three, then that he lived no longer. The Psalm of <i>Moses</i> hath
mentioned a year of danger differing from all these: and that is ten
times 7 or seventy; for so it is said, The daies of Man are threescore
and ten. And the very same is affirmed by <i>Solon</i>, as <i>Herodotus</i>
relates in a speech of his unto <i>Cr≈ìsus</i>, <i>Ego annis septuaginta
human√¶ vit√¶ modum definio</i>: and surely that year must be of greatest
danger, which is the Period of all the rest; and fewest safely pass
thorow that, which is set as a bound for few or none to pass. And
therefore the consent of elder times, setling their conceits upon
Climacters, not only differing from this of ours, but one another;
though several Nations and Ages do fancy unto themselves different years
of danger, yet every one expects the same event, and constant verity in
each.</p>

<p>Again, Though <i>Varro</i> divided the daies of man into five proportions,
<i>Hippocrates</i> into 7, and <i>Solon</i> into 10; yet probably their divisions
were to be received with latitude, and their considerations not strictly
to be confined unto their last unities. So when <i>Varro</i> extendeth
<i>Puertia</i> unto 15. <i>Adolescentia</i> unto 30. <i>Juventus</i> unto 35. There is
a latitude between the terms or Periods of compute, and the verity holds
good in the accidents of any years between them. So when <i>Hippocrates</i>
divideth our life into 7 degrees or stages, and maketh the end of the
first 7. Of the second 14. Of the third 28. Of the fourth 35. Of the
fift 47.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span> Of the sixt 56. And of the seventh, the last year when ever it
happeneth; herein we may observe, he maketh not his divisions precisely
by 7 and 9, and omits the great Climacterical; beside there is between
every one at least the latitude of 7 years, in which space or interval,
that is either in the third or fourth year, what ever falleth out is
equally verified of the whole degree, as though it had happened in the
seventh. <i>Solon</i> divided it into ten Septenaries, because in every one
thereof, a man received some sensible mutation; in the first is
Dedention or falling of teeth; in the second Pubescence; in the third
the beard groweth; in the fourth strength prevails; in the fift maturity
for issue; in the sixt moderation of appetite; in the seventh prudence,
etc. Now herein there is a tolerable latitude, and though the division
proceed by 7, yet is not the total verity to be restrained unto the last
year; nor constantly to be expected the beard should be compleat at 21.
or wisdom acquired just in 49. and thus also though 7 times 9 contain
one of those septenaries, and doth also happen in our declining years;
yet might the events thereof be imputed unto the whole septenary; and be
more reasonably entertained with some latitude, then strictly reduced
unto the last number, or all the accidents from 56. imputed unto Sixty
three.</p>

<p>Thirdly, Although this opinion may seem confirmed by observation, and
men may say it hath been so observed, yet we speak also upon experience,
and do believe that men from observation will collect no satisfaction.
That other years may be taken against it, especially if they have the
advantage to precede it; as sixty against sixty three, and sixty three
against sixty six. For fewer attain to the latter then the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span> former; and
so surely in the first septenary do most die, and probably also in the
very first year; for all that ever lived were in the account of that
year; beside the infirmities that attend it are so many, and the body
that receives them so tender and inconfirmed, we scarce count any alive
that is not past it.</p>

<p><i>Fabritius Paduanius</i><span class="sidenote">De catena temporis.</span> discoursing of the great
Climacterical, attempts a numeration of eminent men, who died in that
year; but in so small a number, as not sufficient to make a considerable
Induction. He mentioneth but four, <i>Diogenes Cynicus</i>, <i>Dyonysius
Heracleoticus</i>, <i>Xenocrates Platonicus</i>, and <i>Plato</i>. As for
<i>Dionysius</i>, as <i>Censorinus</i> witnesseth, he famished himself in the 82
year of his life; <i>Xenocrates</i> by the testimony of <i>Laertius</i> fell into
a cauldron, and died the same year, and <i>Diogenes</i> the <i>Cynick</i>, by the
same testimony lived almost unto ninety. The date of <i>Plato&rsquo;s</i> death is
not exactly agreed on, but all dissent from this which he determineth:
<i>Neanthes</i> in <i>Laertius</i> extendeth his daies unto 84. <i>Suidas</i> unto 82.
But <i>Hermippus</i> defineth his death in 81. And this account seemeth most
exact; for if, as he delivereth, <i>Plato</i> was born in the 88 Olympiade,
and died in the first year of the 108, the account will not surpass the
year of 81, and so in his death he verified the opinion of his life, and
of the life of man, whose period, as <i>Censorinus</i> recordeth, he placeth
in the Quadrate of 9, or 9 times 9, that is, eighty one: and therefore
as <i>Seneca</i> delivereth, the <i>Magicians</i> at <i>Athens</i> did sacrifice unto
him, as declaring in his death somewhat above humanity; because he died
in the day of his nativity, and without deduction justly accomplished
the year of eighty one. <i>Bodine</i> I confess, delivers a larger list of
men that died in this year<span class="sidenote"><i>Method</i>. Hist.</span>, <i>Moriuntur
innumerabiles anno sexagesimo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span> tertio, Aristoteles, Chrysippus,
Bocatius, Bernardus, Erasmus, Lutherus, Melancthon, Sylvius, Alexander,
Jacobus Sturmius, Nicolaus Causanus, Thomas Linacer, eodem anno Cicero
c√¶sus est.</i> Wherein beside that it were not difficult to make a larger
Catalogue of memorable persons that died in other years, we cannot but
doubt the verity of his Induction. As for <i>Sylvius</i> and <i>Alexander</i>,
which of that name he meaneth I know not; but for <i>Chrysippus</i>, by the
testimony of <i>Laertius</i>, he died in the 73 year, <i>Bocatius</i> in the 62,
<i>Linacer</i> the 64, and <i>Erasmus</i> exceedeth 70, as <i>Paulus Jovius</i> hath
delivered in his Elogy of learned men. And as for <i>Cicero</i>, as
<i>Plutarch</i> in his life affirmeth, he was slain in the year of 64; and
therefore sure the question is hard set, and we have no easie reason to
doubt, when great and entire Authors shall introduce injustifiable
examples, and authorize their assertions by what is not authentical.</p>

<p>Fourthly, They which proceed upon strict numerations, and will by such
regular and determined waies measure out the lives of men, and
periodically define the alterations of their tempers; conceive a
regularity in mutations, with an equality in constitutions, and forget
that variety, which Physitians therein discover. <span class="sidenote"><i>Cholerick men
commonly shorter lived.</i></span> For seeing we affirm that women do naturally
grow old before men, that the cholerick fall short in long√¶vity of the
sanguine, that there is <i>senium ante senectum</i>, and many grow old before
they arrive at age, we cannot affix unto them all one common point of
danger, but should rather assign a respective fatality unto each. Which
is concordant unto the doctrine of the numerists, and such as maintain
this opinion: for they affirm that one number respecteth Men, another
Women, as <i>Bodin</i> explaineth that of <i>Seneca Septimus quisque<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span> annus
√¶tati signum imprimit</i>, subjoins <i>Hoc de maribus dictum oportuit, hoc
primum intueri licet, perfectum numerum, id est, sextum f√¶minas
septenarium mares immutare.</i></p>

<p>Fiftly, Since we esteem this opinion to have some ground in nature, and
that nine times seven revolutions of the Sun, imprints a dangerous
Character on such as arrive unto it; it will have some doubt behind, in
what subjection hereunto were the lives of our fore-fathers presently
after the flood, and more especially before it; who attaining unto 8 or
900 years, had not their Climacters Computable by digits, or as we do
account them; for the great Climacterical was past unto them before they
begat Children, or gave any Testimony of their virility; for we read not
that any begat children before the age of sixty five. And this may also
afford a hint to enquire, what are the Climacters of other animated
creatures; whereof the lives of some attain not so far as this of ours,
and that of others extend a considerable space beyond it.</p>

<p>Lastly, The imperfect accounts that Men have kept of time, and the
difference thereof both in the same and divers common Wealths, will much
distract the certainty of this assertion. For though there were a
fatality in this year, yet divers were, and others might be out in their
account, aberring several waies from the true and just compute, and
calling that one year, which perhaps might be another.</p>

<p>For first, They might be out in the commencement or beginning of their
account; for every man is many months elder then he computeth. For
although we begin the same from our nativity, and conceive that no
arbitrary, but natural term of compute, yet for the duration of life or
existence, we are liable in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span> Womb unto the usual distinctions of
time; and are not to be exempted from the account of age and life, where
we are subject to diseases, and often suffer death. And therefore
<i>Pythagoras</i>, <i>Hippocrates</i>, <i>Diocles</i>, <i>Avicenna</i> and others, have set
upon us numeral relations and temporal considerations in the womb; not
only affirming the birth of the seventh month to be vital, that of the
eighth mortal, but the progression thereto to be measured by rule, and
to hold a proportion unto motion and formation. As what receiveth motion
in the seventh, to be perfected in the Triplicities; that is, the time
of conformation unto motion is double, and that from motion unto the
birth, treble; So what is formed the 35 day, is moved the seventy, and
born the 210 day. And therefore if any invisible causality there be,
that after so many years doth evidence it self as Sixty three, it will
be questionable whether its activity only set out at our nativity, and
begin not rather in the womb, wherein we place the like considerations.
Which doth not only entangle this assertion, but hath already embroiled
the endeavours of Astrology in the erection of Schemes, and the judgment
of death or diseases; for being not incontroulably determined, at what
time to begin, whether at conception, animation or exclusion (it being
indifferent unto the influence of Heaven to begin at either) they have
invented another way, that is, to begin <i>ab Hora qu√¶stionis</i>, as <i>Haly</i>,
<i>Messahallach</i>, <i>Ganivetus</i>, and <i>Guido Bonatus</i> have delivered.</p>

<p>Again, In regard of the measure of time by months and years, there will
be no small difficulty; and if we shall strictly consider it, many have
been and still may be mistaken. For neither the motion of the Moon,
whereby months are computed; nor of the Sun, whereby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span> years are
accounted, consisteth of whole numbers, but admits of fractions, and
broken parts, as we have already declared concerning the Moon. That of
the Sun consisteth of 365 daies, and almost 6 hours, that is, wanting
eleven minutes; which 6 hours omitted, or not taken notice of, will in
process of time largely deprave the compute; and this is the occasion of
the Bissextile or leap-year, which was not observed in all times, nor
punctually in all Common-Wealths; so that in Sixty three years there may
be lost almost 18 daies, omitting the intercalation of one day every
fourth year, allowed for this quadrant, or 6 hours supernumerary. And
though the same were observed, yet to speak strictly a man may be
somewhat out in the account of his age at Sixty three, for although
every fourth year we insert one day, and so fetch up the quadrant, yet
those eleven minutes whereby the year comes short of perfect 6 hours,
will in the circuit of those years arise unto certain hours; and in a
larger progression of time unto certain daies. Whereof at present we
find experience in the Calender we observe. For the <i>Julian</i> year of 365
daies being eleven minutes larger then the annual revolution of the Sun,
there will arise an anticipation in the √Üquinoxes; and as <i>Junctinus</i>
<span class="sidenote">Comment. in Sph√¶ram Ioh. de Sacro bosco.</span> computeth, in every 136
year they will anticipate almost one day. And therefore those ancient
men and Nestors of old times, which yearly observed their nativities,
might be mistaken in the day; nor that to be construed without a grain
of Salt, which is delivered by <i>Moses</i>; At the end of four hundred
years, even the self same day, all the host of <i>Israel</i> went out of the
land of <i>Egypt</i>. For in that space of time the √Üquinoxes had
anticipated, and the eleven minutes had amounted far above a day. And
this compute rightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span> considered will fall fouler on them who cast up
the lives of Kingdoms, and sum up their duration by particular numbers;
as <i>Plato</i> first began, and some have endeavoured since by perfect and
spherical numbers, by the square and cube of 7 and 9 and 12, the great
number of <i>Plato</i>. Wherein indeed <i>Bodine</i><span class="sidenote">Mat. Histor.</span> hath
attempted a particular enumeration; but (beside the mistakes committible
in the solary compute of years) the difference of Chronology disturbs
the satisfaction and quiet of his computes; some adding, others
detracting, and few punctually according in any one year; whereby indeed
such accounts should be made up; for the variation in an unite destroys
the total illation.</p>

<p>Thirdly, The compute may be unjust not only in a strict acception, of
few daies or hours, but in the latitude also of some years; and this may
happen from the different compute of years in divers Nations, and even
such as did maintain the most probable way of account: their year being
not only different from one another, but the civil and common account
disagreeing much from the natural year, whereon the consideration is
founded. Thus from the testimony of <i>Herodotus</i>, <i>Censorinus</i> and
others, the <i>Greeks</i> observed the Lunary year,<span class="sidenote"><i>The Lunary year
what.</i></span> that is, twelve revolutions of the Moon, 354 daies; but the
<i>Egyptians</i>, and many others adhered unto the Solary account, <span class="sidenote"><i>The
Solary year what.</i></span> that is, 365 daies, that is, eleven daies longer.
Now hereby the account of the one would very much exceed the other: A
man in the one would account himself 63, when one in the other would
think himself but 61; and so although their nativities were under the
same hour, yet did they at different years believe the verity of that
which both esteemed affixed and certain unto one. The like mistake there
is in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span> tradition of our daies; men conceiving a peculiar danger in the
beginning daies of <i>May</i>, set out as a fatal period unto consumptions
and Chronical diseases; wherein notwithstanding we compute by Calenders,
not only different from our ancestors, but one another; the compute of
the one anticipating that of the other; so that while we are in <i>April</i>,
others begin <i>May</i>, and the danger is past unto one, while it beginneth
with another.</p>

<p>Fourthly, Men were not only out in the number of some daies, the
latitude of a few years, but might be wide by whole Olympiades and
divers Decades of years. <span class="sidenote"><i>The different account or measure of a
year.</i></span> For as <i>Censorinus</i> relateth, the ancient <i>Arcadians</i> observed a
year of three months, the <i>Carians</i> of six, the <i>Iberians</i> of four; and
as <i>Diodorus</i> and <i>Xenophon de √Üquivocis</i> alleadgeth, the ancient
<i>Egyptians</i> have used a year of three, two, and one moneth: so that the
Climacterical was not only different unto those Nations, but
unreasonably distant from ours; for Sixty three will pass in their
account, before they arrive so high as ten in ours.</p>

<p>Nor if we survey the account of <i>Rome</i> it self, may we doubt they were
mistaken; and if they feared Climacterical years, might err in their
numeration. For the civil year whereof the people took notice, did
sometimes come short, and sometimes exceed the natural. For according to
<i>Varro</i>, <i>Suctoninus</i> and <i>Censorinus</i>, their year consisted first of
ten months; which comprehended but 304 daies, that is, 61 less than ours
containeth; after by <i>Numa</i> or <i>Tarquine</i> from a superstitious conceit
of imparity were added 51 daies, which made 355, one day more then
twelve revolutions of the Moon. And thus a long time it continued, the
civil compute exceeding the natural; the correction whereof,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span> and the
due ordering of the Leap year was referred unto the Pontifices; who
either upon favour or malice, that some might continue their offices a
longer or shorter time; or from the magnitude of the year that men might
be advantaged, or endamaged in their contracts, by arbitrary
intercalations depraved the whole account. Of this abuse <i>Cicero</i>
accused <i>Verres</i>, which at last proceeded so far, that when <i>Julius
C√¶sar</i> came unto that office, before the redress hereof he was fain to
insert two intercalary months unto <i>November</i> and <i>December</i>, when he
had already inserted 23 daies unto <i>February</i>; so that the year
consisted of 445 daies; a quarter of a year longer then that we observe;
and though at the last the year was reformed, yet in the mean time they
might be out wherein they summed up Climacterical observations.</p>

<p>Lastly, One way more there may be of mistake, and that not unusual among
us, grounded upon a double compute of the year; the one beginning from
the 25 of <i>March</i>, the other from the day of our birth, unto the same
again which is the natural account. Now hereupon many men frequently
miscast their daies; for in their age they deduce the account not from
the day of their birth, but the year of our Lord, wherein they were
born. So a man that was born in <i>January</i> 1582, if he live to fall sick
in the latter end of <i>March</i> 1645, will sum up his age, and say I am now
Sixty three, and in my Climacterical and dangerous year; for I was born
in the year 1582, and now it is 1645, whereas indeed he wanteth many
months of that year, considering the true and natural account unto his
birth; and accounteth two months for a year: and though the length of
time and accumulation of years do render the mistake insensible; yet is
it all one, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span> if one born in <i>January</i> 1644, should be accounted a
year old the 25 of <i>March</i> 1645.</p>

<p>All which perpended, it may be easily perceived with what insecurity of
truth we adhere unto this opinion; ascribing not only effects depending
on the natural period of time unto arbitrary calculations, and such as
vary at pleasure; but confirming our tenets by the uncertain account of
others and our selves. There being no positive or indisputable ground
where to begin our compute; that if there were, men have been several
waies mistaken; the best in some latitude, others in greater, according
to the different compute of divers states, the short and irreconcilable
years of some, the exceeding error in the natural frame of others, and
the lapses and false deductions of ordinary accountants in most.</p>

<p>Which duly considered, together with a strict account and critical
examen of reason, will also distract the witty determinations of
Astrology. That Saturn the enemy of life, comes almost every seventh
year, unto the quadrate or malevolent place; that as the Moon about
every seventh day arriveth unto a contrary sign, so Saturn, which
remaineth about as many years, as the Moon doth daies in one sign, and
holdeth the same consideration in years as the Moon in daies; doth cause
these periculous periods. Which together with other Planets, and
profection of the Horoscope, unto the seventh house, or opposite signs
every seventh year; oppresseth living natures, and causeth observable
mutations, in the state of sublunary things.</p>

<p>Further satisfaction may yet be had from the learned discourse of
<i>Salmasius</i> lately published<span class="sidenote"><i>De annis Climactericis.</i></span>, if any
desire to be informed how different the present observations are from
those of the ancients; how every one hath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span> different Climactericals;
with many other observables, impugning the present opinion.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII_PE_IV" id="CHAPTER_XIII_PE_IV">CHAPTER XIII</a>
<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of the Canicular or Dog daies.</span></h2>


<p>Whereof to speak distinctly: among the Southern constellations two there
are which bear the name of the Dog; the one in 16 degrees of latitude,
containing on the left thigh a Star of the first magnitude, usually
called Procyon or Anticanis, because say some it riseth before the
other; which if truly understood, must be restrained unto those
habitations, who have elevation of pole above thirty two degrees.
Mention thereof there is in <i>Horace,</i><span class="sidenote">Iam Procyon fuerit et stella
vesani Leonis.</span> who seems to mistake or confound the one with the
other; and after him in <i>Galen</i>, who is willing, the remarkablest Star
of the other should be called by this name; because it is the first that
ariseth in the constellation; which notwithstanding, to speak strictly,
it is not; unless we except one of the third magnitude in the right paw
in his own and our elevation, and two more on his head in and beyond the
degree of Sixty. <span class="sidenote"><i>What the Dog-star is.</i></span> A second and more
considerable one there is, and neighbour unto the other, in 40 degrees
of latitude, containing 18 Stars, whereof that in his mouth of the first
magnitude, the <i>Greeks</i> call Œ£ŒµŒØœÅŒπŒøœÇ, the <i>Latines canis major</i>, and we
emphatically the Dog-Star.</p>

<p>Now from the rising of this Star, not cosmically, that is, with the Sun,
but Heliacally, that is, its emersion from the raies of the Sun, the
Ancients computed their canicular daies; concerning which there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
generally passeth an opinion, that during those daies, all medication or
use of physick is to be declined; and the cure committed unto nature.
And therefore as though there were any feriation in nature, or
justitiums imaginable in professions, whose subject is natural, and
under no intermissive, but constant way of mutation; this season is
commonly termed the Physitians vacation, and stands so received by most
men. Which conceit however general, is not only erroneous, but
unnatural, and subsisting upon foundations either false, uncertain,
mistaken or misapplied, deserves not of mankind that indubitable assent
it findeth.</p>

<p>For first, which seems to be the ground of this assertion, and not to be
drawn into question, that is, the magnified quality of this Star
conceived to cause, or intend the heat of this season whereby these
daies become more observable then the rest: We find that wiser Antiquity
was not of this opinion. For, seventeen hundred years ago it was as a
vulgar error rejected by <i>Geminus</i>, a learned Mathematician in his
Elements of Astronomy; wherein he plainly affirmeth, that common opinion
made that a cause, which was at first observed but as a sign. The rising
and setting both of this Star and others being observed by the Ancients,
to denote and testifie certain points of mutation rather then conceived
to induce or effect the same. For our fore-fathers, saith he, observing
the course of the Sun, and marking certain mutations to happen in his
progress through particular parts of the Zodiack, they registred and set
them down in their Parapegmes, or Astronomical Canons; and being not
able to design these times by daies, months or years (the compute
thereof, and the beginning of the year being different, according unto
different Nations) they thought best to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span> settle a general account unto
all; and to determine these alterations by some known and invariable
signs; and such did they conceive the rising and setting of the fixed
Stars; not ascribing thereto any part of causality, but notice and
signification. And thus much seems implied in that expression of
<i>Homer</i>, when speaking of the Dog Star, he concludeth&mdash;&mdash;Œ∫Œ±Œ∫·Ω∏ŒΩ Œ¥Œ≠ œÑŒµ
œÉ·øÜŒºŒ± œÑŒ≠œÑœÖŒ∫œÑŒ±Œπ, <i>Malum autem signum est</i>; The same, as <i>Petavius</i>
observeth, is implied in the word of <i>Ptolomy</i>, and the Ancients, œÄŒµœÅ·Ω∂
·ºêœÄŒπœÉŒ∑ŒºŒ±œÉŒπ·ø∂ŒΩ, that is, of the signification of Stars. The term of
Scripture also favours it, as that of <i>Isaiah</i>, <i>Nolite timere √† signis
c≈ìli</i>; and that in <i>Genesis</i>, <i>Ut sint in signa et tempora</i>: Let
there be lights in the firmament, and let them be for signs and for
seasons.</p>

<p>The Primative and leading magnifiers of this Star, were the <i>Egyptians</i>,
the great admirers of Dogs in Earth and Heaven. <span class="sidenote">Dionysius
Periegesi.</span> Wherein they worshipped <i>Anubis</i> or <i>Mercurius</i>, the Scribe
of <i>Saturn</i>, and Counseller of <i>Osyris</i>, the great inventor of their
religious rites, and Promoter of good unto <i>Egypt</i>. Who was therefore
translated into this Star; by the <i>Egyptians</i> called <i>Sothis</i>, and
<i>Siris</i> by the <i>Ethiopians</i>; from whence that <i>Sirius</i> or the Dog-star
had its name, is by some conjectured.</p>

<p>And this they looked upon, not with reference unto heat, but
c≈ìlestial influence upon the faculties of man, in order to religion
and all sagacious invention; and from hence derived the abundance and
great fertility of <i>Egypt</i>, the overflow of <i>Nilus</i> happening about the
ascent hereof. And therefore in hieroglyphical monuments, <i>Anubis</i> is
described with a Dogs-head, with a Crocodile between his legs, with a
sphere in his hand, with two Stars, and a water Pot standing by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span> him;
implying thereby, the rising and setting of the Dog-star, and the
inundation of the River <i>Nilus</i>.</p>

<p>But if all were silent, <i>Galen</i> hath explained this point unto the life;
who expounding the reason why <i>Hippocrates</i> declared the affections of
the year by the rising and setting of Stars; it was saith he, because he
would proceed on signs and principles best known unto all Nations. And
upon his words in the first of the Epidemicks, <i>In Thaso Autumno circa
Equinoxium et sub virgilias pluvi√¶ erant mult√¶</i>, he thus enlargeth. If
(saith he) the same compute of times and months were observed by all
Nations, <i>Hippocrates</i> had never made any mention either of Arcturus,
Pleiades or the Dog-star; but would have plainly said, in <i>Macedonia</i>,
in the month Dion, thus or thus was the air disposed. But for as much as
the month Dion is only known unto the <i>Macedonians</i>, but obscure unto
the <i>Athenians</i> and other Nations, he found more general distinctions of
time, and instead of naming months, would usually say, at the √Üquinox,
the rising of the Pleiades, or the Dog-star. <span class="sidenote"><i>How the Ancients
divided the seasons of the year.</i></span> And by this way did the Ancients
divide the seasons of the year, the Autumn, Winter, Spring, and Summer.
By the rising of the Pleiades, denoting the beginning of Summer, and by
that of the Dog-star, the declination thereof. By this way <i>Aristotle</i>
through all his books of Animals, distinguishing their times of
generation, latitancy, migration, sanity and venation. And this were an
allowable way of compute, and still to be retained, were the site of the
Stars as inalterable, and their ascents as invariable as primitive
Astronomy conceived them. And therefore though <i>Aristotle</i> frequently
mentioneth this Star, and particularly affirmeth that Fishes in the
Bosphorus are best catched from the arise of the Dog-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span> star, we must not
conceive the same a meer effect thereof. Nor though <i>Scaliger</i> from
hence be willing to infer the efficacy of this Star, are we induced
hereto; except because the same Philosopher affirmeth, that Tunny is fat
about the rising of the Pleiades, and departs upon Arcturus, or that
most insects are latent, from the setting of the 7 Stars; except, I say,
he give us also leave to infer that these particular effects and
alterations proceed from those Stars; which were indeed but designations
of such quarters and portions of the year, wherein the same were
observed. Now what <i>Pliny</i> affirmeth of the Orix, that it seemeth to
adore this Star, and taketh notice thereof by voice and sternutation;
until we be better assured of its verity, we shall not salve the
sympathy.</p>

<p>Secondly, What slender opinion the Ancients held of the efficacy of this
Star, is declarable from their compute. For as <i>Geminus</i> affirmeth, and
<i>Petavius</i> his learned Commentator proveth, they began their account
from its Heliacal emersion, and not its cosmical ascent. <span class="sidenote"><i>What the
Cosmical.</i></span> The cosmical ascention of a Star we term that, when it
ariseth together with the Sun, or the same degree of the Ecliptick
wherein the Sun abideth:<span class="sidenote"><i>What the Heliacal ascent of Star is.</i></span>
and that the Heliacal, when a Star which before for the vicinity of the
Sun was not visible, being further removed, beginning to appear. For the
annual motion of the Sun from West to East being far swifter then that
of the fixed Stars, he must of necessity leave them on the East while he
hasteneth forward, and obscureth others to the West: and so the Moon who
performs its motion swifter then the Sun (as may be observed in their
Conjunctions and Eclipses) gets Eastward out of his raies; and appears
when the Sun is set. If therefore the Dog-star had this effectual heat
which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span> ascribed unto it, it would afford best evidence thereof, and
the season would be most fervent, when it ariseth in the probablest
place of its activity, that is, the cosmical ascent; for therein it
ariseth with the Sun, and is included in the same irradiation. But the
time observed by the Ancients was long after this ascent, and in the
Heliacal emersion; when it becomes at greatest distance from the Sun,
neither rising with it nor near it. And therefore had they conceived any
more then a bare signality in this Star, or ascribed the heat of the
season therunto, they would not have computed from its Heliacal ascent,
which was of inferiour efficacy; nor imputed the vehemency of heat unto
those points wherein it was more remiss, and where with less probability
they might make out its action.</p>

<p>Thirdly, Although we derive the authority of these daies from
observations of the Ancients, yet are our computes very different, and
such as confirm not each other. For whereas they observed it Heliacally,
we seem to observe it Cosmically; for before it ariseth Heliacally unto
our latitude, the Summer is even at an end. Again, we compute not only
from different ascents, but also from divers Stars; they from the
greater Dog-star, we from the lesser; they from <i>Orions</i> we from
<i>Cephalus</i> his Dog; they from <i>Seirius</i>, we from <i>Procyon</i>; for the
beginning of the Dog-daies with us is set down the 19 of <i>July</i>, about
which time the lesser Dog-star ariseth with the Sun; whereas the Star of
the greater Dog ascendeth not until after that month. And this mistake
will yet be larger, if the compute be made stricter, and as Dr.
<i>Bainbrigge</i> late professor of Astronomy in Oxford, hath set it down.
<span class="sidenote">Bainb. Canicularis.</span> Who in the year 1629 computed, that in the
Horizon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span> of <i>Oxford</i> the Dog-star arose not before the fifteenth day of
<i>August</i>; when in our Almanack accounts, those daies are almost ended.
So that the common and received time not answering the true compute, it
frustrates the observations of our selves. And being also different from
the calculations of the Ancients, their observations confirm not ours,
nor ours theirs, but rather confute each other.</p>

<p>Nor will the computes of the Ancients be so Authentick unto those, who
shall take notice, how commonly they applied the celestial descriptions
of other climes unto their own; wherein the learned <i>Bainbrigius</i> justly
reprehendeth <i>Manilius</i>, who transferred the <i>√Ügyptian</i> descriptions
unto the <i>Roman</i> account; confounding the observation of the <i>Greek</i> and
<i>Barbarick</i> Spheres.</p>

<p>Fourthly, (which is the Argument of <i>Geminus</i>) were there any such
effectual heat in this Star, yet could it but weakly evidence the same
in Summer; it being about 40 degrees distant from the Sun: and should
rather manifest its warming power in the Winter, when it remains
conjoyned with the Sun in its Hybernal conversion. For about the 29 of
<i>October</i>, and in the 16 of <i>Scorpius</i> and so again in <i>January</i>, the
Sun performs his revolution in the same parallel with the Dog-star.
Again, If we should impute the heat of this season, unto the
co-operation of any Stars with the Sun, it seems more favourable for our
times, to ascribe the same unto the constellation of <i>Leo</i>. Where
besides that the Sun is in his proper house, it is conjoyned with many
Stars; whereof two of the first magnitude; and in the 8{th} of <i>August</i>
is corporally conjoyned with <i>Basilicus</i>; a Star of eminent name in
Astrology, and seated almost in the Ecliptick.</p>

<p>Fifthly, If all were granted, that observation and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span> reason were also for
it, and were it an undeniable truth, that an effectual fervour proceeded
from this Star; yet would not the same determine the opinion now in
question; it necessarily suffering such restrictions as take off general
illations. For first in regard of different latitudes, unto some the
canicular daies are in the Winter; as unto such as have no latitude, but
live in a right Sphere, that is, under the Equinoctial line; for unto
them it ariseth when the Sun is about the Tropick of Cancer; which
season unto them is Winter, and the Sun remotest from them. Nor hath the
same position in the Summer, that is, in the Equinoctial points, any
advantage from it; for in the one point the Sun is at the Meridian,
before the Dog-star ariseth; in the other the Star is at the Meridian,
before the sun ascendeth.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>What latitudes have no Dog-daies at all.</i></div>

<p>Some latitudes have no canicular daies at all; as namely all those which
have more then 73 degrees of Northern Elevation; as the territory of
<i>Nova Zembla</i>, part of <i>Greenland</i> and <i>Tartary</i>; for unto that
habitation the Dog-star is invisible, and appeareth not above the
Horizon.</p>

<p>Unto such latitudes wherein it ariseth, it carrieth a various and very
different respect; unto some it ascendeth when Summer is over, whether
we compute Heliacally or Cosmically; for though unto <i>Alexandria</i> it
ariseth in Cancer; yet it ariseth not unto Biarmia Cosmically before it
be in Virgo, and Heliacally about the Autumnal Equinox. Even unto the
latitude of 52, the efficacy thereof is not much considerable, whether
we consider its ascent, Meridian, altitude or abode above the Horizon.
For it ariseth very late in the year, about the eighteenth of <i>Leo</i>,
that is, the 31 of <i>July</i>. Of Meridian Altitude it hath but 23 degrees,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
so that it plaies but obliquely upon us, and as the Sun doth about the
23 of <i>January</i>. And lastly, his abode above the Horizon is not great;
for in the eighteenth of <i>Leo</i>, the 31 of <i>July</i>, although they arise
together; yet doth it set above 5 hours before the Sun, that is, before
two of the clock, after which time we are more sensible of heat, then
all the day before.</p>

<p>Secondly, In regard of the variation of the longitude of the Stars, we
are to consider (what the Ancients observed not) that the site of the
fixed Stars is alterable, and that since elder times they have suffered
a large and considerable variation of their longitudes. <span class="sidenote"><i>What the
longitude of a Star is.</i></span> The longitude of a Star, to speak plainly, is
its distance from the first point of numeration toward the East; which
first point unto the Ancients was the vernal √¶quinox. Now by reason of
their motion from West to East, they have very much varied from this
point: The first Star of Aries in the time of <i>Meton</i> the <i>Athenian</i> was
placed in the very intersection, which is now elongated and removed
Eastward 28 degrees; insomuch that now the sign of Aries possesseth the
place of Taurus, and Taurus that of Gemini. Which variation of longitude
must very much distract the opinion of the Dog star; not only in our
daies, but in times before and after; for since the World began it hath
arisen in Taurus, and if the World last, may have its ascent in Virgo;
so that we must place the canicular daies, that is, the hottest time of
the year in the Spring in the first age, and in the Autumn in Ages to
come.</p>

<p>Thirdly, The Stars have not only varied their longitudes, whereby their
ascents have altered; but have also changed their declinations, whereby
their rising at all, that is, their appearing hath varied. <span class="sidenote"><i>What
the declination of a Star is.</i></span> The declination of a Star we call its
distance from the Equator.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span> Now though the Poles of the world and the
Equator be immovable, yet because the Stars in their proper motions from
West to East, do move upon the poles of the Ecliptick, distant 23
degrees and an half from the Poles of the Equator, and describe circles
parallel not unto the Equator, but the Ecliptick; they must be therefore
sometimes nearer, sometimes removed further from the Equator. All Stars
that have their distance from the Ecliptick Northward not more then 23
degrees and an half (which is the greatest distance of the Ecliptick
from the Equator) may in progression of time have declination Southward,
and move beyond the Equator: but if any Star hath just this distance of
23 and an half (as hath Capella on the back of Ericthonius) it may
hereafter move under the Equinoctial; and the same will happen
respectively unto Stars which have declination Southward. And therefore
many Stars may be visible in our Hemisphere, which are not so at
present; and many which are at present, shall take leave of our Horizon,
and appear unto Southern habitations. And therefore the time may come
that the Dog star may not be visible in our Horizon, and the time hath
been, when it hath not shewed it self unto our neighbour latitudes. So
that canicular daies there have been none, nor shall be; yet certainly
in all times some season of the year more notably hot then other.</p>

<p>Lastly, We multiply causes in vain; and for the reason hereof, we need
not have recourse unto any Star but the Sun, and continuity of its
action. For the Sun ascending into the Northern signs, begetteth first a
temperate heat in the air; which by his approach unto the solstice he
intendeth; and by continuation increaseth the same even upon
declination. <span class="sidenote"><i>Why the Dog-daies be so hot.</i></span> For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span> running over the
same degrees again, that is, in Leo, which he hath done in Taurus, in
<i>July</i> which he did in <i>May</i>; he augmenteth the heat in the latter which
he began in the first; and easily intendeth the same by continuation
which was well promoted before. So it is observed, that they which dwell
between the Tropicks and the Equator, have their second summer hotter
and more maturative of fruits then the former. So we observe in the day
(which is a short year) the greatest heat about two in the afternoon,
when the Sun is past the Meridian (which is his diurnal solstice) and
the same is evident from the Thermometer or observations of the
weather-glass. So are the colds of the night sharper in the Summer about
two or three after midnight, and the frosts in Winter stronger about
those hours. So likewise in the year we observe the cold to augment,
when the daies begin to increase, though the Sun be then ascensive, and
returning from the Winter Tropick. And therefore if we rest not in this
reason for the heat in the declining part of Summer, we must discover
freezing Stars that may resolve the latter colds of Winter; which
whoever desires to invent, let him study the Stars of <i>Andromeda</i>, or
the nearer constellation of <i>Pegasus</i>, which are about that time
ascendent.</p>

<p>It cannot therefore seem strange, or savour of singularity that we have
examined this point; since the same hath been already denied by some,
since the authority and observations of the Ancients rightly understood,
do not confirm it, since our present computes are different from those
of the Ancients, whereon notwithstanding they depend; since there is
reason against it, and if all were granted, yet must it be maintained
with manifold restraints, far otherwise then is received. And lastly,
since from plain and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span> natural principles, the doubt may be fairly
salved, and not clapt up from petitionary foundations and principles
unestablished.</p>

<p>But that which chiefly promoted the consideration of these daies, and
medically advanced the same, was the doctrin of <i>Hippocrates</i>; a
Physitian of such repute, that he received a testimony from a Christian,
that might have been given unto Christ. <span class="sidenote">Qui nec fallere potest nec
falli.</span> The first in his book, <i>de Acre, Aquis, et locis</i>. <i>Syderum
ortus</i>, etc. That is, we are to observe the rising of Stars, especially
the Dog-star, Arcturus, and the setting of the Pleiades or seven Stars.
From whence notwithstanding we cannot infer the general efficacy of
these Stars, or co-efficacy particular in medications. Probably
expressing no more hereby then if he should have plainly said, especial
notice we are to take of the hottest time in Summer, of the beginning of
Autumn and Winter; for by the rising and setting of those Stars were
these times and seasons defined. <span class="sidenote"><i>Diseases commonly determined, by
what seasons.</i></span> And therefore subjoyns this reason, <i>Quoniam his
temporibus morbi finiuntur</i>, because at these times diseases have their
ends; as Physitians well known, and he elsewhere affirmeth, that seasons
determine diseases, beginning in their contraries; as the Spring the
diseases of Autumn, and the Summer those of Winter. Now (what is very
remarkable) whereas in the some place he adviseth to observe the times
of notable mutations, as the Equinoxes, and the Solstices, and to
decline Medication ten daies before and after; how precisely soever
canicular cautions be considered, this is not observed by Physitians,
nor taken notice of by the people. And indeed should we blindly obey the
restraints both of Physitians and Astrologers, we should contract the
liberty of our prescriptions, and confine the utility of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span> Physick unto a
very few daies. For observing the Dog-daies, and as is expressed, some
daies before, likewise ten daies before and after the Equinoctial and
Solsticial points; by this observation alone are exempted an hundred
daies. Whereunto if we add the two <i>Egyptian</i> daies in every month, the
interlunary and plenilunary exemptions, the Eclipses of Sun and Moon,
conjunctions and oppositions Planetical, the houses of Planets, and the
site of the Luminaries under the signs (wherein some would induce a
restraint of Purgation or Phlebotomy) there would arise above an hundred
more; so that of the whole year the use of Physick would not be secure
much above a quarter. Now as we do not strictly observe these daies, so
need we not the other; and although consideration be made hereof, yet
must we prefer the nearer indications before those which are drawn from
the time of the year; or other c√¶lestial relations.</p>

<p>The second Testimony is taken out of the last piece of his Age, and
after the experience (as some think) of no less then an hundred years,
that is, his book of Aphorisms, or short and definitive determinations
in Physick. The Aphorism alleadged is this, <i>Sub Cane et ante Canem
difficiles sunt purgationes.</i> <i>Sub Cane et Anticane</i>, say some including
both the Dog-stars; but that cannot consist with the Greek: ·ΩëœÄ·Ω∏ Œ∫œçŒΩŒ± Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂
œÄœÅ·Ω∏ Œ∫œÖŒΩ·Ω∏œÇ, nor had that Criticism been ever omitted by <i>Galen</i>. Now how
true this sentence was in the mouth of <i>Hippocrates</i>, and with what
restraint it must be understood by us, will readily appear from the
difference between us both, in circumstantial relations.</p>

<p>And first, Concerning his time and Chronology: <span class="sidenote"><i>When</i> Hippocrates
<i>lived</i>.</span> he lived in the reign of <i>Artaxerxes Longimanus</i>, about the 82
Olympiade, 450 years before Christ; and from our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span> times above two
thousand. Now since that time (as we have already declared) the Stars
have varied their longitudes; and having made large progressions from
West to East, the time of the Dog-stars ascent must also very much
alter. For it ariseth later now in the year, then it formerly did in the
same latitude; and far later unto us who have a greater elevation; for
in the daies of <i>Hippocrates</i> this Star ascended in Cancer, which now
ariseth in Leo: and will in progression of time arise in Virgo. And
therefore in regard of the time wherein he lived, the Aphorism was more
considerable in his daies then in ours, and in times far past then
present, and in his Countrey then ours.</p>

<p>The place of his nativity was <i>Coos</i>, an Island in the <i>Myrtoan</i> Sea,
not far from <i>Rhodes</i>, described in Maps by the name of <i>Lango</i>, and
called by the <i>Turks</i> who are Masters thereof, <i>Stancora</i>; according
unto <i>Ptolomy</i> of Northern latitude 36 degrees. That he lived and writ
in these parts, is not improbably collected from the Epistles that
passed betwixt him and <i>Artaxerxes</i>; as also between the Citizens of
<i>Abdera</i>, and <i>Coos</i>, in the behalf of <i>Democritus</i>. Which place being
seated from our latitude of 52, 16 degrees Southward, there will arise a
different consideration; and we may much deceive our selves if we
conform the ascent of Stars in one place unto another, or conceive they
arise the same day of the month in <i>Coos</i> and in <i>England</i>. For as
<i>Petavius</i> computes in the first <i>Julian</i> year, at <i>Alexandria</i> of
latitude 31, the Star arose cosmically in the twelfth degree of Cancer,
Heliacally the 26, by the compute of <i>Geminus</i> about this time at
<i>Rhodes</i> of latitude 37, it ascended cosmically the 16 of Cancer,
Heliacally the first of Leo; and about that time at <i>Rome</i> of latitude
42, cosmically the 22 of Cancer, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span> Heliacally the first of Leo. For
unto places of greater latitude it ariseth ever later; so that in some
latitudes the cosmical ascent happeneth not before the twentieth degree
of Virgo, ten daies before the Autumnal Equinox, and if they compute
Heliacally, after it, in Libra.</p>

<p>Again, Should we allow all, and only compute unto the latitude of
<i>Coos</i>; yet would it not impose a total omission of Physick. For if in
the hottest season of that clime, all Physick were to be declined, then
surely in many other none were to be used at any time whatsoever; for
unto many parts, not only in the Spring and Autumn, but also in the
Winter, the Sun is nearer, then unto the clime of <i>Coos</i> in the Summer.</p>

<p>The third consideration concerneth purging medicines, which are at
present far different from those implied in this Aphorism, and such as
were commonly used by <i>Hippocrates</i>. <span class="sidenote"><i>Three degrees of
purgations.</i></span> For three degrees we make of purgative medicines: The
first thereof is very benign, nor far removed from the nature of
Aliment, into which, upon defect of working, it is oft-times converted;
and in this form do we account <i>Manna</i>, <i>Cassia</i>, <i>Tamarindes</i>, and many
more; whereof we find no mention in <i>Hippocrates</i>. This second is also
gentle having a familiarity with some humor, into which it is but
converted if it fail of its operation: of this sort are <i>Aloe</i>,
<i>Rhabarb</i>, <i>Senna</i>, etc. Whereof also few or none were known unto
<i>Hippocrates</i>. The third is of a violent and venemous quality, which
frustrate of its action, assumes as it were the nature of poison; such
as are Scammoneum, Colocynthis, Elaterium, Euphorbium, Tithymallus,
Laureola, Peplum, etc. Of this sort <i>Hippocrates</i> made use, even in
Fevers, Pleurisies and Quinsies; and that composition is very remarkable
which is ascribed unto <i>Diogenes</i> in <i>√Ütius</i>;<span class="sidenote">Tetrab. lib. 1. Serm.
3.</span> that is, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span> Pepper, Sal Armoniac, Euphorbium, of each an ounce,
the Dosis whereof four scruples and an half; which whosoever should
take, would find in his bowels more then a canicular heat, though in the
depth of Winter; many of the like nature may be observed in <i>√Ütius</i>, or
in the book <i>De Dinamidiis</i>, ascribed unto <i>Galen</i>, which is the same
<i>verbatim</i> with the other.</p>

<p>Now in regard of the second, and especially the first degree of
Purgatives, the Aphorism is not of force; but we may safely use them,
they being benign and of innoxious qualities. And therefore <i>Lucas
Gauricus</i>, who hath endeavoured with many testimonies to advance this
consideration, at length concedeth that lenitive Physick may be used,
especially when the Moon is well affected in Cancer or in the watery
signs. But in regard of the third degree the Aphorism is considerable:
purgations may be dangerous; and a memorable example there is in the
medical Epistles of <i>Crucius</i>, of a <i>Roman</i> Prince that died upon an
ounce of Diaph√¶nicon, taken in this season. From the use whereof we
refrain not only in hot seasons, but warily exhibit it at all times in
hot diseases. Which when necessity requires, we can perform more safely
then the Ancients, as having better waies of preparation and correction;
that is, not only by addition of other bodies, but separation of noxious
parts from their own.</p>

<p>But beside these differences between <i>Hippocrates</i> and us, the
Physitians of these times and those of Antiquity; the condition of the
disease, and the intention of the Physitian, hold a main consideration
in what time and place soever. For Physick is either curative or
preventive; Preventive we call that which by purging noxious humors, and
the causes of diseases, preventeth sickness in the healthy, or the
recourse thereof<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span> in the valetudinary; this is of common use at the
spring and fall, and we commend not the same at this season.
Therapeutick or curative Physick, we term that, which restoreth the
Patient unto Sanity, and taketh away diseases actually affecting.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Diseases Chronical and Acute what they be.</i></span> Now of diseases some are
cronical and of long duration, as quartane Agues, Scurvy, etc. Wherein
because they admit of delay we defer the cure to more advantagious
seasons; Others we term acute, that is, of short duration and danger, as
Fevers, Pleurisies, etc. In which, because delay is dangerous, and they
arise unto their state before the Dog-daies determine, we apply present
remedies according unto Indications; respecting rather the acuteness of
the disease, and precipitancy of occasion, then the rising or setting of
Stars; the effects of the one being disputable, of the other assured and
inevitable.</p>

<p>And although Astrology may here put in, and plead the secret influence
of this Star; yet <i>Galen</i> in his Comment, makes no such consideration;
confirming the truth of the Aphorism from the heat of the year; and the
operation of Medicines exhibited. <span class="sidenote"><i>Strong purgations not so well
given in the heat of summer, and why.</i></span> In regard that bodies being
heated by the Summer, cannot so well endure the acrimony of purging
Medicines; and because upon purgations contrary motions ensue, the heat
of the air attracting the humours outward, and the action of the
Medicine retracting the same inward. But these are readily salved in the
distinctions before alleadged; and particularly in the constitution of
our climate and divers others, wherein the air makes no such exhaustion
of spirits. And in the benignity of our Medicines; whereof some in their
own natures, others well prepared, agitate not the humors, or make
sensible perturbation.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote15"><i>A Problem.</i></div>

<p>Nor do we hereby reject or condemn a sober and regulated Astrology; we
hold there is more truth therein then in Astrologers; in some more then
many allow, yet in none so much as some pretend. We deny not the
influence of the Stars, but often suspect the due application thereof;
for though we should affirm that all things were in all things; that
heaven were but earth celestified, and earth but heaven terrestrified,
or that each part above had an influence upon its divided affinity
below; yet how to single out these relations, and duly to apply their
actions is a work oft times to be effected by some revelation, and
<i>Cabala</i> from above, rather then any Philosophy, or speculation here
below. What power soever they have upon our bodies, it is not requisite
they should destroy our reasons, that is, to make us rely on the
strength of Nature, when she is least able to relieve us; and when we
conceive the heaven against us, to refuse the assistance of the earth
created for us. <span class="sidenote15"><i>Upon the biting of a mad Dog there ensues an
hydrophobia or fear of water.</i></span> This were to suffer from the mouth of
the Dog above, what others do from the teeth of Dogs below; that is, to
be afraid of their proper remedy, and refuse to approach any water,
though that hath often proved a cure unto their disease. There is in
wise men a power beyond the Stars; and <i>Ptolomy</i> encourageth us, that by
foreknowledge, we may evade their actions; for, being but universal
causes, they are determined by particular agents; which being inclined,
not constrained, contain within themselves the casting act, and a power
to command the conclusion.</p>

<p>Lastly, If all be conceded, and were there in this Aphorism an
unrestrained truth, yet were it not reasonable from a caution to inferr
a non-usance or abolition, from a thing to be used with discretion, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
to be used at all. Because the Apostle bids us beware of Philosophy,
heads of extremity will have none at all; an usual fallacy in vulgar and
less distinctive brains, who having once overshot the mean, run
violently on, and find no rest but in the extreams.</p>

<p>Now hereon we have the longer insisted, because the error is material,
and concerns oft-times the life of man; an error to be taken notice of
by State, and provided against by Princes, who are of the opinion of
<i>Solomon</i>, that their riches consists in the multitude of their
subjects. An error worse then some reputed <i>Heresies</i>; and of greater
danger to the body, then they unto the soul; which whosoever is able to
reclaim, he shall salve more in one summer then <i>Themison</i><span class="sidenote"><i>A
Physitian.</i> Quot Themison √¶gros Autumno occiderit uno. <i>Juvenal.</i></span>
destroyed in any Autumn; he shall introduce a new way of cure,
preserving by Theory, as well as practice, and men not only from death,
but from destroying themselves.</p>

<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of many things questionable as they are
commonly described in Pictures.</span></h2>




<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I_PE_V" id="CHAPTER_I_PE_V">CHAPTER I</a>
<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of the Picture of the Pelecan.</span></h2>


<p>And first in every place we meet with the picture of the Pelecan,
opening her breast with her bill, and feeding her young ones with the
blood distilling from her. Thus is it set forth not only in common
Signs, but in the Crest and Schucheon of many Noble families; hath been
asserted by many holy Writers, and was an Hierogliphick of piety and
pitty among the <i>√Ügyptians</i>; on which consideration, they spared them at
their tables.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding upon enquiry we find no mention hereof in Ancient
Zodiographers, and such as have particularly discoursed upon Animals, as
<i>Aristotle</i>, <i>√Ülian</i>, <i>Pliny</i>, <i>Solinus</i> and many more; who seldom
forget proprieties of such a nature, and have been very punctual in less
considerable Records. Some ground hereof I confess we may allow, nor
need we deny a remarkable affection in Pelecans toward their young; for
<i>√Ülian</i> discoursing of Storks, and their affection toward their brood,
whom they instruct to fly, and unto whom they re-deliver up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span> the
provision of their Bellies, concludeth at last, that Herons and Pelecans
do the like.</p>

<p>As for the testimonies of Ancient Fathers, and Ecclesiastical Writers,
we may more safely conceive therein some Emblematical than any real
Story: so doth <i>Eucherius</i> confess it to be the Emblem of Christ. And we
are unwilling literally to receive that account of <i>Jerom</i>, that
perceiving her young ones destroyed by Serpents, she openeth her side
with her bill, by the blood whereof they revive and return unto life
again. By which relation they might indeed illustrate the destruction of
man by the old Serpent, and his restorement by the blood of Christ: and
in this sense we shall not dispute the like relations of <i>Austine</i>,
<i>Isidore</i>, <i>Albertus</i>, and many more: and under an Emblematical
intention, we accept it in coat-armour.</p>

<p>As for the Hieroglyphick of the <i>Egyptians</i>, they erected the same upon
another consideration, which was parental affection; manifested in the
protection of her young ones, when her nest was set on fire. For as for
letting out her blood, it was not the assertion of the <i>Egyptians</i>, but
seems translated unto the Pelecan from the Vulture, as <i>Pierius</i> hath
plainly delivered. <i>Sed quod Pelicanum (ut etiam aliis plerisque
persuasum est) rostro pectus dissecantem pingunt, ita ut suo sanguine
filios alat, ab √Ügyptiorum histori√¢ valde alienum est, illi enim
vulturem tantum id facere tradiderunt.</i></p>

<p>And lastly, as concerning the picture, if naturally examined, and not
Hierogliphically conceived, it containeth many improprieties,
disagreeing almost in all things from the true and proper description.
For, whereas it is commonly set forth green or yellow, in its proper
colour, it is inclining to white; excepting the extremities or tops of
the wing feathers, which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span> brown. <span class="sidenote"><i>The bigness of a Pelecan.</i></span>
It is described in the bigness of a Hen, whereas it approacheth and
sometimes exceedeth the magnitude of a Swan. It is commonly painted with
a short bill; whereas that of the Pelecan attaineth sometimes the length
of two spans. The bill is made acute or pointed at the end; whereas it
is flat and broad, though somewhat inverted at the extream. It is
described like fissipedes, or birds which have their feet or claws
divided; whereas it is palmipedous, or fin-footed like Swans and Geese;
according to the method of nature, in latirostrous or flat-bild birds;
which being generally swimmers, the organ is wisely contrived unto the
action, and they are framed with fins or oars upon their feet; and
therefore they neither light, nor build on trees, if we except
Cormorants, who make their nests like Herons. <span class="sidenote15"><i>Of her Crop.</i></span>
Lastly, there is one part omitted more remarkable than any other, that
is, the chowle or crop adhering unto the lower side of the bill, and so
descending by the throat: a bag or sachel very observable, and of a
capacity almost beyond credit; which notwithstanding, this animal could
not want; for therein it receiveth Oysters, Cochels, Scollops, and other
testaceous animals; which being not able to break, it retains them until
they open, and vomiting them up, takes out the meat contained. This is
that part preserved for a rarity and wherein (as <i>Sanctius</i> delivers) in
one dissected, a <i>Negro</i> child was found.</p>

<p>A possibility there may be of opening and bleeding their breast; for
this may be done by the uncous and pointed extremity of their bill: and
some probability also that they sometimes do it, for their own relief,
though not for their young ones; that is by nibling and biting
themselves on their itching part of their breast, upon fullness or
acrimony of blood. And the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span> same may be better made out; if (as some
relate) their feathers on that part are sometimes observed to be red and
tincted with blood.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II_PE_V" id="CHAPTER_II_PE_V">CHAPTER II</a>
<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of the Picture of Dolphins.</span></h2>


<p>That Dolphins are crooked, is not only affirmed by the hand of the
Painter, but commonly conceived their natural and proper figure; which
is not only the opinion of our times, but seems the belief of elder
times before us. For, beside the expressions of <i>Ovid</i> and <i>Pliny</i>,
their Pourtraicts in some ancient Coyns are framed in this figure, as
will appear in some thereof in <i>Gesner</i>, others in <i>Goltsius</i>, and
<i>L√¶vinus Hulsius</i> in his discription of Coyns, from <i>Julius C√¶sar</i> unto
<i>Rhodulphus</i> the second.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding, to speak strictly in their natural figure they are
streight, nor have their spine convexed, or more considerably embowed,
than Sharks, Porposes, Whales, and other Cetaceous animals, as
<i>Scaliger</i> plainly affirmeth: <i>Corpus habet non magis curvum quam
reliqui pisces.</i> As ocular enquiry informeth; and as unto such as have
not had the opportunity to behold them, their proper pourtraicts will
discover in <i>Rondeletius</i>, <i>Gesner</i>, and <i>Aldrovandus</i>. And as indeed is
deducible from pictures themselves; for though they be drawn repandous,
or convexedly crooked in one piece, yet the Dolphin that carrieth Arion
is concavously inverted, and hath its spine depressed in another. And
answerably hereto may we behold them differently bowed in medalls, and
the Dolphins of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span> <i>Tarus</i> and <i>Fulius</i> do make another flexure from that
of <i>Commodus</i> and <i>Agrippa</i>.</p>

<p>And therefore what is delivered of their incurvity, must either be taken
Emphatically, that is, not really but in appearance; which happeneth,
when they leap above water, and suddenly shoot down again; which is a
fallacy in vision, whereby straight bodies in a sudden motion protruded
obliquely downward, appear unto the eye crooked; and this is the
construction of <i>Bellonius</i>. Or if it be taken really, it must not
universally and perpetually; that is, not when they swim and remain in
their proper figures, but only when they leap, or impetuously whirl
their bodies any way; and this is the opinion of <i>Gesnerus</i>. Or lastly,
It may be taken neither really nor emphatically, but only
Emblematically: for being the Hieroglyphick of celerity, and swifter
than other animals, men best expressed their velocity by incurvity, and
under some figure of a bow: and in this sense probably do Heralds also
receive it, when from a Dolphin extended, they distinguish a Dolphin
embowed.</p>

<p>And thus also must that picture be taken of a Dolphin clasping an
Anchor: that is, not really, as is by most conceived out of affection
unto man, conveighing the Anchor unto the ground: but emblematically,
according as <i>Pierius</i> hath expressed it, The swiftest animal conjoyned
with that heavy body, implying that common moral, <i>Festina lent√®</i>: and
that celerity should always be contempered with cunctation.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III_PE_V" id="CHAPTER_III_PE_V">CHAPTER III</a>
<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of the Picture of a Grashopper.</span></h2>


<p>There is also among us a common description and picture of a Grashopper,
as may be observed in the pictures of Emblematists, in the coats of
several families, and as the word <i>Cicada</i> is usually translated in
Dictionaries. Wherein to speak strictly, if by this word Grashopper, we
understand that animal which is implied by œÑŒ≠œÑœÑŒπŒæ with the <i>Greeks</i>, and
by <i>Cicada</i> with the <i>Latines</i>; we may with safety affirm the picture is
widely mistaken, and that for ought enquiry can inform, there is no such
insect in <i>England</i>. Which how paradoxical soever, upon a strict
enquiry, will prove undeniable truth.</p>

<p>For first, That animal which the <i>French</i> term <i>Sauterelle</i>, we a
Grashopper, and which under this name is commonly described by us, is
named ·ºåŒ∫œÅŒπœÇ by the <i>Greeks</i>, by the <i>Latines Locusta</i>, and by our
selves in proper speech a Locust; as in the diet of John <i>Baptist</i>, and
in our Translation,<span class="sidenote10">Prov. 30.</span> the <i>Locusts</i> have no King, yet go
they forth all of them by bands. Again, Between the <i>Cicada</i> and that we
call a Grashopper, the differences are very many, as may be observed in
themselves, or their descriptions in <i>Matthiolus</i>, <i>Aldrovandus</i> and
<i>Muffetus</i>. For first, They are differently cucullated or capuched upon
the head and back, and in the <i>Cicada</i> the eyes are more prominent: the
Locusts have <i>Antenn√¶</i>: or long horns before, with a long falcation or
forcipated tail behind; and being ordained for saltation, their hinder
legs do far exceed the other. The Locust or our Grashopper hath teeth,
the <i>Cicada</i> none at all; nor any mouth according unto <i>Aristotle</i>: the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
<i>Cicada</i> is most upon trees; and lastly, the fritinnitus or proper note
thereof, is far more shril than that of the Locust; and its life so
short in Summer, that for provision it needs not have recourse unto the
providence of the Pismire in Winter.</p>

<p>And therefore where the <i>Cicada</i> must be understood, the pictures of
Heralds and Emblematists are not exact, nor is it safe to adhere unto
the interpretation of Dictionaries; and we must with candour make out
our own Translations: for in the Plague of <i>√Ügypt</i>, <i>Exodus</i> 10. the
word ·ºåŒ∫œÅŒπœÇ is translated a Locust, but in the same sense and subject,
<i>Wisdom</i> 16. it is translated a Grashopper; For them the bitings of
Grashoppers and flies killed: whereas we have declared before, the
<i>Cicada</i> hath no teeth, but is conceived to live upon dew; and the
possibility of its subsistence is disputed by <i>Licetus</i>. Hereof I
perceive <i>Muffetus</i> hath taken notice, dissenting from <i>Langius</i> and
<i>Lycostenes</i>, while they deliver, the <i>Cicada&rsquo;s</i> destroyed the fruits in
<i>Germany</i>, where that insect is not found; and therefore concludeth,
<i>Tam ipsos quam alios deceptos fuisse autumo, dum locustas cicadas esse
vulgari errore crederent.</i></p>

<p>And hereby there may be some mistake in the due dispensation of
Medicines desumed from this animal; particularly of Diatettigon
commended by <i>√Ütius</i> in the affections of the kidnies. It must be
likewise understood with some restriction what hath been affirmed by
<i>Isidore</i>, and yet delivered by many, that Cicades are bred out of
Cuccow spittle or Woodsear; that is, that spumous, frothy dew or
exudation, or both, found upon Plants, especially about the joints of
Lavender and Rosemary, observable with us about the latter end of May.
For here the true <i>Cicada</i> is not bred,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span> but certain it is, that out of
this, some kind of Locust doth proceed; for herein may be discovered a
little insect of a festucine or pale green, resembling in all parts a
Locust, or what we call a Grashopper.</p>

<p>Lastly, The word it self is improper, and the term of Grashopper not
appliable unto the <i>Cicada</i>; for therein the organs of motion are not
contrived for saltation, nor are the hinder legs of such extension, as
is observable in salient animals, and such as move by leaping. Whereto
the Locust is very well conformed; for therein the legs behind are
longer than all the body, and make at the second joynt acute angles, at
a considerable advancement above their backs.</p>

<p>The mistake therefore with us might have its original from a defect in
our language; for having not the insect with us, we have not fallen upon
its proper name, and so make use of a term common unto it and the
Locust; whereas other countries have proper expressions for it. So the
<i>Italian</i> calls it <i>Cicada</i>, the <i>Spaniard Cigarra</i>, and the <i>French
Cigale</i>; all which appellations conform unto the original, and properly
express this animal. Whereas our word is borrowed from the Saxon
G√¶rsthopp, which our forefathers, who never beheld the <i>Cicada</i>, used
for that insect which we yet call a Grashopper.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV_PE_V" id="CHAPTER_IV_PE_V">CHAPTER IV</a>
<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of the Picture of the Serpent tempting Eve.</span></h2>


<p>In the Picture of Paradise, and delusion of our first Parents, the
Serpent is often described with humane visage; not unlike unto <i>Cadmus</i>
or his wife, in the act of their Metamorphosis. Which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span> not a meer
pictorial contrivance or invention of the Picturer, but an ancient
tradition and conceived reality, as it stands delivered by <i>Beda</i> and
Authors of some antiquity; that is, that Sathan appeared not unto <i>Eve</i>
in the naked form of a Serpent, but with a Virgins head, that thereby he
might become more acceptable, and his temptation find the easier
entertainment. Which nevertheless is a conceit not to be admitted, and
the plain and received figure, is with better reason embraced.</p>

<p>For first, as <i>Pierius</i> observeth from <i>Barcephas</i>, the assumption of
humane shape had proved a disadvantage unto Sathan; affording not only a
suspicious amazement in <i>Eve</i>, before the fact, in beholding a third
humanity beside her self and <i>Adam</i>; but leaving some excuse unto the
woman, which afterward the man took up with lesser reason; that is, to
have been deceived by another like her self.</p>

<p>Again, There was no inconvenience in the shape assumed, or any
considerable impediment that might disturb that performance in the
common form of a Serpent. For whereas it is conceived the woman must
needs be afraid thereof, and rather flie than approach it; it was not
agreeable unto the condition of Paradise and state of innocency therein;
if in that place as most determine, no creature was hurtful or terrible
unto man, and those destructive effects they now discover succeeded the
curse, and came in with thorns and briars. And therefore <i>Eugubinus</i>
(who affirmeth this Serpent was a Basilisk) incurreth no absurdity, nor
need we infer that <i>Eve</i> should be destroyed immediately upon that
Vision. For noxious animals could offend them no more in the Garden,
than <i>Noah</i> in the Ark: as they peaceably received their names, so they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
friendly possessed their natures: and were their conditions destructive
unto each other, they were not so unto man, whose constitutions then
were antidotes, and needed not fear poisons. And if (as most conceive)
there were but two created of every kind, they could not at that time
destroy either man or themselves; for this had frustrated the command of
multiplication, destroyed a species, and imperfected the Creation. And
therefore also if Cain were the first man born, with him entred not only
the act, but the first power of murther; for before that time neither
could the Serpent nor <i>Adam</i> destroy <i>Eve</i>; nor <i>Adam</i> and <i>Eve</i> each
other; for that had overthrown the intention of the world, and put its
Creator to act the sixt day over again.</p>

<p>Moreover, Whereas in regard of speech, and vocal conference with <i>Eve</i>,
it may be thought he would rather assume an humane shape and organs,
then the improper form of a serpent; it implies no material impediment.
Nor need we to wonder how he contrived a voice out of the mouth of a
Serpent, who hath done the like out of the belly of a Pythonissa, and
the trunk of an Oak; as he did for many years at <i>Dodona</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Why</i> Eve <i>wondered not at the serpents speaking</i>.</div>

<p>Lastly, Whereas it might be conceived that an humane shape was fitter
for this enterprise; it being more than probable she would be amazed to
hear a Serpent speak; some conceive she might not yet be certain that
only man was priviledged with speech; and being in the novity of the
Creation, and inexperience of all things, might not be affrighted to
hear a Serpent speak. Beside she might be ignorant of their natures, who
was not versed in their names, as being not present at the general
survey of Animals, when <i>Adam</i> assigned unto every one a name
con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>cordant unto its nature. Nor is this my opinion, but the
determination of <i>Lombard</i> and <i>Tostatus</i>; and also the reply of <i>Cyril</i>
unto the objection of <i>Julian</i>, who compared this story unto the fables
of the <i>Greeks</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V_PE_V" id="CHAPTER_V_PE_V">CHAPTER V</a>
<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of the Picture of <i>Adam</i> and <i>Eve</i> with Navels.</span></h2>


<p>Another mistake there may be in the Picture of our first Parents, who
after the manner of their posterity are both delineated with a Navel.
And this is observable not only in ordinary and stained pieces, but in
the Authentick draughts of <i>Urbin</i>, <i>Angelo</i> and others. Which
notwithstanding cannot be allowed, except we impute that unto the first
cause, which we impose not on the second; or what we deny unto nature,
we impute unto Naturity it self; that is, that in the first and most
accomplished piece, the Creator affected superfluities, or ordained
parts without use or office.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>What the Navel is, and for what use.</i></div>

<p>For the use of the Navel is to continue the Infant unto the Mother, and
by the vessels thereof to convey its aliment and sustentation. The
vessels whereof it consisteth, are the umbilical vein, which is a branch
of the Porta, and implanted in the Liver of the Infant; two Arteries
likewise arising from the Iliacal branches, by which the Infant
receiveth the purer portion of blood and spirits from the mother; and
lastly, the Urachos or ligamental passage derived from the bottom of the
bladder, whereby it dischargeth the waterish and urinary part of its
aliment. Now upon the birth, when the Infant forsaketh the womb,
although it dilacerate, and break the involving membranes, yet do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span> these
vessels hold, and by the mediation thereof the Infant is connected unto
the womb, not only before, but a while also after the birth. These
therefore the midwife cutteth off, contriving them into a knot close
unto the body of the Infant; from whence ensueth that tortuosity or
complicated modosity we usually call the Navel; occasioned by the
colligation of vessels before mentioned. <span class="sidenote"><i>That</i> Adam <i>and</i> Eve <i>had
not Navels</i>.</span> Now the Navel being a part, not precedent, but subsequent
unto generation, nativity or parturition, it cannot be well imagined at
the creation or extraordinary formation of <i>Adam</i>, who immediately
issued from the Artifice of God; nor also that of <i>Eve</i>; who was not
solemnly begotten, but suddenly framed, and anomalously proceeded from
<i>Adam</i>.</p>

<p>And if we be led into conclusions that <i>Adam</i> had also this part,
because we behold the same in our selves, the inference is not
reasonable; for if we conceive the way of his formation, or of the first
animals, did carry in all points a strict conformity unto succeeding
productions, we might fall into imaginations that <i>Adam</i> was made
without Teeth; or that he ran through those notable alterations in the
vessels of the heart, which the Infant suffereth after birth: we need
not dispute whether the egg or bird were first; and might conceive that
Dogs were created blind, because we observe they are littered so with
us. Which to affirm, is to confound, at least to regulate creation unto
generation, the first Acts of God, unto the second of Nature; which were
determined in that general indulgence, Encrease and Multiply, produce or
propagate each other; that is, not answerably in all points, but in a
prolonged method according to seminal progression. For the formation of
things at first was different from their generation after; and although
it had nothing to pre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>cede it, was aptly contrived for that which should
succeed it. And therefore though <i>Adam</i> were framed without this part,
as having no other womb than that of his proper principles, yet was not
his posterity without the same: for the seminality of his fabrick
contained the power thereof; and was endued with the science of those
parts whose predestinations upon succession it did accomplish.</p>

<p>All the Navel therefore and conjunctive part we can suppose in <i>Adam</i>,
was his dependency on his Maker, and the connexion he must needs have
unto heaven, who was the Son of God. For holding no dependence on any
preceding efficient but God; in the act of his production there may be
conceived some connexion, and <i>Adam</i> to have been in a momental Navel
with his Maker. And although from his carnality and corporal existence,
the conjunction seemeth no nearer than of causality and effect; yet in
his immortal and diviner part he seemed to hold a nearer coherence, and
an umbilicality even with God himself. And so indeed although the
propriety of this part be found but in some animals, and many species
there are which have no Navel at all; yet is there one link and common
connexion, one general ligament, and necessary obligation of all what
ever unto God. Whereby although they act themselves at distance, and
seem to be at loose; yet do they hold a continuity with their Maker.
Which catenation or conserving union when ever his pleasure shall
divide, let go, or separate, they shall fall from their existence,
essence, and operations: in brief, they must retire unto their primitive
nothing, and shrink into their Chaos again.</p>

<p>They who hold the egg was before the Bird, prevent this doubt in many
other animals, which also extendeth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span> unto them: For birds are nourished
by umbilical vessels, and the Navel is manifest sometimes a day or two
after exclusion. The same is probable in oviparous exclusions, if the
lesser part of eggs must serve for the formation, the greater part for
nutriment. The same is made out in the eggs of Snakes; and is not
improbable in the generation of Porwiggles or Tadpoles, and may be also
true in some vermiparous exclusions: although (as we have observed in
the daily progress in some) the whole Maggot is little enough to make a
Fly, without any part remaining.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI_PE_V" id="CHAPTER_VI_PE_V">CHAPTER VI</a>
<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of the Pictures of Eastern Nations, and the
<i>Jews</i> at their Feasts, especially our
<i>Saviour</i> at the Passover.</span></h2>


<p>Concerning the Pictures of the <i>Jews</i>, and Eastern Nations at their
Feasts, concerning the gesture of our Saviour at the Passover, who is
usually described sitting upon a stool or bench at a square table, in
the middest of the twelve, many make great doubt; and (though they
concede a table-gesture) will hardly allow this usual way of Session.</p>

<p>Wherein restraining no mans enquiry, it will appear that accubation, or
lying down at meals was a gesture used by very many Nations. That the
<i>Persians</i> used it, beside the testimony of humane Writers, is deducible
from that passage in <i>Esther</i>.<span class="sidenote10">Esther 7.</span> That when the King
returned into the place of the banquet of wine, <i>Haman</i> was fallen upon
the bed whereon <i>Esther</i> was. That the <i>Parthians</i> used it, is evident
from <i>Athen√¶us</i>, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span> delivereth out of <i>Possidonius</i>, that their King
lay down at meals, on an higher bed than others. That <i>Cleopatra</i> thus
entertained <i>Anthony</i>, the same Author manifesteth when he saith, she
prepared twelve Tricliniums. That it was in use among the <i>Greeks</i>, the
word Triclinium implieth, and the same is also declarable from many
places in the Symposiacks of <i>Plutarch</i>. That it was not out of fashion
in the days of <i>Aristotle</i>, he declareth in his politicks; when among
the Institutionary rules of youth, he adviseth they might not be
permitted to hear Iambicks and Tragedies before they were admitted unto
discumbency or lying along with others at their meals. That the <i>Romans</i>
used this gesture at repast, beside many more, is evident from
<i>Lipsius</i>, <i>Mercurialis</i>, <i>Salmasius</i> and <i>Ciaconius</i>, who have expresly
and distinctly treated hereof.</p>

<p>Now of their accumbing places, the one was called Stibadion and Sigma,
carrying the figure of an half Moon, and of an uncertain capacity,
whereupon it received the name of Hexaclinon, Octoclinon, according unto
that of <i>Martial</i>,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="line"><i>Accipe Lunata scriptum testudine Sigma:</i></div>
<div class="line"><i>Octo capit, veniat quisquis amicus erit.</i></div>
</div></div>

<p>Hereat in several ages the left and right horn were the principal
places, and the most honorable person, if he were not master of the
feast, possessed one of those rooms. The other was termed Triclinium,
that is, Three beds about a table, as may be seen in the figures
thereof, and particularly in the <i>Rhamnusian</i> Triclinium, set down by
<i>Mercurialis</i>.<span class="sidenote">Merc. De Arte Gymnastica.</span> The customary use hereof
was probably deduced from the frequent use of bathing, after which they
commonly retired to bed, and refected themselves with repast; and so
that custom by degrees changed their cubiculary beds into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span> discubitory,
and introduced a fashion to go from the bathes unto these.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The ancient gesture or position of the body at feasts.</i></div>

<p>As for their gesture or position, the men lay down leaning on their left
elbow, their back being advanced by some pillow or soft substance: the
second lay so with his back towards the first, that his head attained
about his bosome; and the rest in the same order. For women, they sat
sometimes distinctly with their sex, sometime promiscuously with men,
according to affection or favour, as is delivered by <i>Juvenal</i>,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="line"><i>Gremio jacuit nova nupta mariti.</i></div>
</div></div>

<p>And by <i>Suetonius</i> of <i>Caligula</i>, that at his feasts he placed his
sisters, with whom he had been incontinent, successively in order below
him.</p>

<p>Again, As their beds were three, so the guests did not usually exceed
that number in every one; according to the ancient Laws, and proverbial
observations to begin with the Graces, and make up their feasts with the
Muses. And therefore it was remarkable in the Emperour <i>Lucius Verus</i>,
that he lay down with twelve: which was, saith <i>Julius Capitolinus,
pr√¶ter exempla majorum</i>, not according to the custom of his
Predecessors, except it were at publick and nuptial suppers. The regular
number was also exceeded in this last supper, whereat there were no less
than thirteen, and in no place fewer than ten, for, as <i>Josephus</i>
delivereth, it was not lawful to celebrate the Passover with fewer than
that number.</p>

<p>Lastly, For the disposing and ordering of the persons: The first and
middle beds were for the guests, the third and lowest for the Master of
the house and his family; he always lying in the first place of the last
bed, that is, next the middle bed; but if the wife or children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span> were
absent, their rooms were supplied by the Umbr√¶, or hangers on, according
to that of <i>Juvenal</i> <span class="sidenote"><i>Who the Umbr√¶ were at banquets.</i></span>&mdash;&mdash;<i>Locus
est et pluribus Umbris.</i> For the guests, the honourablest place in every
bed was the first, excepting the middle or second bed; wherein the most
honourable Guest of the feast was placed in the last place, because by
that position he might be next the Master of the feast.<span class="sidenote"><i>Iul.
Scalig. familiarium exercitationum Problema 1.</i></span> For the Master lying
in the first of the last bed, and the principal Guest in the last place
of the second, they must needs be next each other; as this figure doth
plainly declare, and whereby we may apprehend the feast of <i>Perpenna</i>
made unto <i>Sertorius</i>, described by <i>Salustius</i>, whose words we shall
thus read with <i>Salmasius</i>: <i>Igitur discubuere, Sertorius inferior in

<p>At this feast there were but seven; the middle places of the highest and
middle bed being vacant; and hereat was <i>Sertorius</i> the General and
principal guest slain. And so may we make out what is delivered by
<i>Plutarch</i> in his life, that lying on his back, and raising himself up,
<i>Perpenna</i> cast himself upon his stomack; which he might very well do,
being Master of the feast, and lying next unto him. And thus also from
this Tricliniary disposure, we may illustrate that obscure expression of
<i>Seneca</i>; That the Northwind was in the middle, the North-East on the
higher side, and the North-West on the lower. For as appeareth in the
circle of the winds, the North-East will answer the bed of <i>Antonius</i>,
and the North-West that of <i>Perpenna</i>.</p>

<p>That the custom of feasting upon beds was in use among the <i>Hebrews</i>,
many deduce from <i>Ezekiel</i>.<span class="sidenote10">Ezek. 23.</span> Thou sattest upon a stately
bed, and a table prepared before it. The custom of Discalceation or
putting off their shoes at meals, is conceived to confirm the same; as
by that means keeping their beds clean; and therefore they had a
peculiar charge to eat the Passover with their shooes on; which
Injunction were needless, if they used not to put them off. However it
were in times of high antiquity, probable it is that in after ages they
conformed unto the fashions of the <i>Assyrians</i> and Eastern Nations, and
lastly of the <i>Romans</i>, being reduced by <i>Pompey</i> unto a Provincial
subjection.</p>

<p>That this discumbency at meals was in use in the days of our Saviour, is
conceived probable from several speeches of his expressed in that
phrase, even unto common Auditors, as <i>Luke</i> 14. <i>Cum invitatus fueris
ad nuptias, non discumbas in primo loco</i>, and besides many more,
<i>Matthew</i> 23. When reprehending the <i>Scribes</i> and <i>Pharises</i>, he saith,
<i>Amant protoclisias, id est, primos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span> recubitus in c√¶nis, et
protocathedrias, sive, primas cathedras, in Synagogis</i>: wherein the
terms are very distinct, and by an Antithesis do plainly distinguish the
posture of sitting, from this of lying on beds. The consent of the
<i>Jews</i> with the <i>Romans</i> in other ceremonies and rites of feasting,
makes probable their conformity in this. The <i>Romans</i> washed, were
anointed, and wore a cenatory garment: and that the same was practised
by the <i>Jews</i>, is deduceable from that expostulation of our Saviour with
<i>Simon</i>,<span class="sidenote10">Luke 7.</span> that he washed not his feet, nor anointed his head
with oyl; the common civilities at festival entertainments; and that
expression of his concerning the cenatory or wedding garment;<span class="sidenote10">Matth.
22.</span> and as some conceive of the linnen garment of the young man or St.
<i>John</i>; which might be the same he wore the night before at the last
Supper.</p>

<p>That they used this gesture at the Passover, is more than probable from
the testimony of <i>Jewish</i> Writers, and particularly of <i>Ben-maimon</i>
recorded by <i>Scaliger De emendatione temporum</i>. After the second cup
according to the Institution.<span class="sidenote10">Exod. 12.</span> The Son asketh, what
meaneth this service? Then he that maketh the declaration, saith, How
different is this night from all other nights? for all other nights we
wash but once but this night twice; all other we eat leavened or
unleavened bread, but this only leavened; all other we eat flesh
roasted, boyled or baked, <a name="CORR5" id="CORR5"><ins class="correction" title="original: by">but</ins></a> this only roasted, all other nights we eat
together lying or sitting, but this only lying along. And this posture
they used as a token of rest and security which they enjoyed, far
different from that at the eating of the Passover in <i>√Ügypt</i>.</p>

<p>That this gesture was used when our Saviour eat the Passover, is not
conceived improbable from the words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span> whereby the Evangelists express the
same, that is, ·ºÄŒΩŒ±œÄŒØœÄœÑŒµŒπŒΩ, ·ºÄŒΩŒ±Œ∫Œµ·øñœÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ, Œ∫Œ±œÑŒ±Œ∫Œµ·øñœÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ, ·ºÄŒΩŒ±Œ∫ŒªŒµŒπŒ∏·øÜŒΩŒ±Œπ, which
terms do properly signifie this Gesture in <i>Aristotle</i>, <i>Athen√¶us</i>,
<i>Euripides</i>, <i>Sophocles</i>, and all humane Authors; and the like we meet
with in the paraphrastical expression of <i>Nonnus</i>.</p>

<p>Lastly, If it be not fully conceded, that this gesture was used at the
Passover, yet that it was observed at the last supper, seems almost
incontrovertible: for at this feast or cenatory convention, learned men
make more than one supper, or at least many parts thereof. The first was
that Legal one of the Passover, or eating of the Paschal Lamb with
bitter herbs, and ceremonies described by <i>Moses</i>. Of this it is
said,<span class="sidenote10">Matth. 26.</span> then when the even was come he sat down with the
twelve. This is supposed when it is said,<span class="sidenote10">John 13.</span> that the supper
being ended, our Saviour arose, took a towel and washed the disciples
feet. The second was common and Domestical, consisting of ordinary and
undefined provisions; of this it may be said, that our Saviour took his
garment, and sat down again, after he had washed the Disciples feet, and
performed the preparative civilities of suppers; at this &rsquo;tis conceived
the sop was given unto <i>Judas</i>, the Original word implying some broath
or decoction, not used at the Passover. The third or latter part was
Eucharistical, which began at the breaking and blessing of the bread,
according to that of <i>Matthew</i>, And as they were eating, Jesus took
bread and blessed it.</p>

<p>Now although at the Passover or first supper, many have doubted this
Reclining posture, and some have affirmed that our Saviour stood; yet
that he lay down at the other, the same men have acknowledged, as
<i>Chrysostom</i>, <i>Theophylact</i>, <i>Austin</i>, and many more. And if the
tradition will hold, the position is unquestion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>able; for the very
Triclinium is to be seen at <i>Rome</i>, brought thither by <i>Vespasian</i>, and
graphically set forth by <i>Casalius</i>.<span class="sidenote">De veterum ritibus.</span></p>

<p>Thus may it properly be made out; what is delivered, <i>John</i> 13. <i>Erat
recumbens unus ex Discipulis ejus in sinu Jesu quem diligebat</i>; Now
there was leaning on Jesus bosom one of his Disciples whom Jesus loved;
which gesture will not so well agree unto the position of sitting, but
is natural, and cannot be avoided in the Laws of accubation. And the
very same expression is to be found in <i>Pliny</i>, concerning the Emperour
<i>Nerva</i> and <i>Veiento</i> whom he favoured; <i>C≈ìnabat Nerva cum paucis,
Veiento recumbebat proprius atque etiam in sinu</i>; and from this custom
arose the word ·ºêœÄŒπœÉœÑŒÆŒ∏ŒπŒøœÇ, that is, a near and bosom friend.
And therefore <i>Causabon</i> <span class="sidenote15"><i>Not</i> in Evan.</span> justly rejecteth
<i>Theophylact</i>; who not considering the ancient manner of decumbency,
imputed this gesture of the beloved Disciple unto Rusticity, or an act
of incivility. And thus also have some conceived, it may be more plainly
made out what is delivered of <i>Mary Magdalen</i>.<span class="sidenote10">Luke 7.</span> That she
stood at Christs feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet
with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head. Which actions,
if our Saviour sat, she could not perform standing, and had rather stood
behind his back, than at his feet. And therefore it is not allowable,
what is observable in many pieces, and even of <i>Raphael Urbin</i>; wherein
<i>Mary Magdalen</i> is pictured before our Saviour, washing his feet on her
knees; which will not consist with the strict description and letter of
the Text.</p>

<p>Now whereas this position may seem to be discountenanced by our
Translation, which usually renders it sitting, it cannot have that
illation, for the <i>French</i> and <i>Italian</i> Translations expressing neither
position of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span> session or recubation, do only say that he placed himself
at the table; and when ours expresseth the same by sitting, it is in
relation unto our custom, time, and apprehension. The like upon occasion
is not unusual: so when it is said, <i>Luke</i> 4. œÄœÑœçŒæŒ±œÇ œÑ·Ω∏ Œ≤ŒπŒ≤ŒªŒØŒøŒΩ, and the
Vulgar renders it, <i>Cum plicasset librum</i>, ours translateth it, he shut
or closed the book; which is an expression proper unto the paginal books
of our times, but not so agreeable unto volumes or rolling books in use
among the <i>Jews</i>, not only in elder times, but even unto this day.
<span class="sidenote"><i>What</i> Denarius, <i>or the penny in the Gospel is</i>.</span> So when it is said,
the <i>Samaritan</i> delivered unto the host two pence for the provision of
the <i>Levite</i>; and when our Saviour agreed with the Labourers for a penny
a day, in strict translation it should be seven pence half penny; and is
not to be conceived our common penny, the sixtieth part of an ounce. For
the word in the Original is Œ¥Œ∑ŒΩŒ¨œÅŒπŒøŒΩ, in Latine, <i>Denarius</i>, and with
the <i>Romans</i> did value the eight part of an ounce, which after five
shillings the ounce amounteth unto seven pence half penny of our money.</p>

<p>Lastly, Whereas it might be conceived that they eat the Passover
standing rather than sitting, or lying down, according to the
Institution, <i>Exod.</i> 12. <span class="sidenote"><i>Ceremonies of the Passover omitted.</i></span>
Thus shall you eat, with your loins girded, your shooes on your feet,
and your staff in your hand; the <i>Jews</i> themselves reply, this was not
required of succeeding generations, and was not observed, but in the
Passover of <i>√Ügypt</i>. And so also many other injunctions were afterward
omitted, as the taking up of the Paschal Lamb, from the tenth day, the
eating of it in their houses dispersed; the striking of the blood on the
door posts, and the eating thereof in hast. Solemnities and Ceremonies
primitively enjoyned, afterward omitted; as was also this of station,
for the occasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span> ceasing, and being in security, they applied
themselves unto gestures in use among them.</p>

<p>Now in what order of recumbancy Christ and the Disciples were disposed,
is not so easily determined. <i>Casalius</i> from the Lateran Triclinium will
tell us, that there being thirteen, five lay down in the first bed, five
in the last, and three in the middle bed; and that our Saviour possessed
the upper place thereof. That <i>John</i> lay in the same bed seems plain,
because he leaned on our Saviours bosom. That <i>Peter</i> made the third in
that bed, conjecture is made, because he beckened unto <i>John</i>, as being
next to him, to ask of Christ, who it was that should betray him. That
<i>Judas</i> was not far off seems probable, not only because he dipped in
the same dish, but because he was so near, that our Saviour could hand
the sop unto him.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII_PE_V" id="CHAPTER_VII_PE_V">CHAPTER VII</a>
<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of the Picture of our Saviour with long hair.</span></h2>


<p>Another Picture there is of our Saviour described with long hair,
according to the custom of the <i>Jews</i>, and his description sent by
<i>Lentulus</i> unto the Senate. Wherein indeed the hand of the Painter is
not accusable, but the judgement of the common Spectator; conceiving he
observed this fashion of his hair; because he was a <i>Nazarite</i>, and
confounding a <i>Nazarite</i> by vow, with those by birth or education.</p>

<p>The <i>Nazarite</i> by vow is declared, <i>Numb.</i> 6. And was to refrain three
things, drinking of Wine, cutting the hair, and approaching unto the
dead; and such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span> one was <i>Sampson</i>. Now that our Saviour was a
<i>Nazarite</i> after this kind, we have no reason to determine; for he drank
Wine, and was therefore called by the <i>Pharisees</i>, a Wine-bibber; he
approached also the dead, as when he raised from death <i>Lazarus</i>, and
the daughter of <i>Jairus</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p><p>The other <i>Nazarite</i> was a Topical appellation, and appliable unto such
as were born in <i>Nazareth</i>, a City of <i>Galilee</i>, and in the Tribe of
<i>Napthali</i>. Neither if strictly taken was our Saviour in this sense a
<i>Nazarite</i>; for he was born in <i>Bethlehem</i> in the Tribe of <i>Judah</i>; but
might receive that name, because he abode in that City; and was not only
conceived therein, but there also passed the silent part of his life,
after his return from <i>√Ügypt</i>; as is delivered by <i>Matthew</i>, And he came
and dwelt in a City called <i>Nazareth</i>, that it might be fulfilled which
was spoken by the Prophet, He shall be called a <i>Nazarene</i>. Both which
kinds of <i>Nazarites</i>, as they are distinguishable by <i>Zain</i>, and <i>Tsade</i>
in the Hebrew, so in the Greek, by <i>Alpha</i> and <i>Omega</i>; for as
<i>Jansenius</i> observeth,<span class="sidenote">Ians. Concordia Evangelica.</span> where the votary
<i>Nazarite</i> is mentioned, it is written, ŒùŒ±Œ∂Œ±œÅŒ±·øñœåœÇ, as <i>Levit.</i> 6. and
<i>Lament.</i> 4. Where it is spoken of our Saviour, we read it, ŒùŒ±Œ∂œâœÅŒµ·øñŒøœÇ,
as in <i>Matthew</i>, <i>Luke</i> and <i>John</i>; only <i>Mark</i> who writ his Gospel at

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII_PE_V" id="CHAPTER_VIII_PE_V">CHAPTER VIII</a>
<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of the Picture of <i>Abraham</i> sacrificing <i>Isaac</i>.</span></h2>


<p>In the Picture of the Immolation of <i>Isaac</i>, or <i>Abraham</i> sacrificing
his son, <i>Isaac</i> is described as a little boy; which notwithstanding is
not consentaneous unto the authority of Expositors, or the circumstance
of the Text. For therein it is delivered that <i>Isaac</i> carried on his
back the wood for the sacrifice; which being an holocaust or burnt
offering to be consumed unto ashes, we cannot well conceive a burthen
for a boy; but such a one unto <i>Isaac</i>, as that which it typified was
unto Christ, that is, the wood or cross whereon he suffered; which was
too heavy a load for his shoulders, and was fain to be relieved therein
by <i>Simon</i> of <i>Cyrene</i>.</p>

<p>Again, He was so far from a boy, that he was a man grown, and at his
full stature, if we believe <i>Josephus</i>, who placeth him in the last of
<i>Adolescency</i>, and makes him twenty five years old. And whereas in the
Vulgar Translation he is termed <i>puer</i>, it must not be strictly
apprehended (for that age properly endeth in puberty, and extendeth but
unto fourteen) but respectively unto <i>Abraham</i>, who was at that time
above sixscore. And therefore also herein he was not unlike unto him,
who was after led dumb unto the slaughter, and commanded by others, who
had legions at command; that is, in meekness and humble submission. For
had he resisted, it had not been in the power of his aged parent to have
enforced; and many at his years have performed such acts, as few besides
at any. <span class="sidenote"><i>Men of eminent fame and prowess at 25.</i></span> <i>David</i> was too

<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of the Picture of <i>Moses</i> with horns.</span></h2>


<p>In many pieces, and some of ancient Bibles, <i>Moses</i> is described with
horns. The same description we find in a silver Medal; that is, upon one
side <i>Moses</i> horned, and on the reverse the commandment against
sculptile Images. Which is conceived to be a coynage of some <i>Jews</i>, in
derision of Christians, who first began that Pourtract.</p>

<p>The ground of this absurdity, was surely a mistake of the Hebrew Text,
in the history of <i>Moses</i> when he descended from the Mount;<span class="sidenote10">Exod.
34.29, 35.</span> upon the affinity of <i>K√¶ren</i> and <i>Karan</i>, that is, an horn,
and to shine, which is one quality of horn: The Vulgar Translation
conforming unto the former. <i>Ignorabat quod cornuta esset facies ejus.
Qui videbant faciem Mosis esse cornutam.</i> But the <i>Chaldee</i> paraphrase,
translated by <i>Paulus Fagius</i>, hath otherwise expressed it. <i>Moses
nesciebat quod multus esset splendor glori√¶ vultus ejus. Et viderunt
filii Israel quod multa esset claritas glori√¶ faciei Moses.</i> The
expression of the Septuagint is as large, Œ¥ŒµŒ¥œåŒæŒ±œÉœÑŒ±Œπ ·º° ·ΩÑœàŒπœÇ œÑŒø·ø¶ œáœÅœéŒºŒ±œÑŒøœÇ
œÑŒø·ø¶ œÄœÅŒøœÉœéœÄŒøœÖ, <i>Glorificatus est aspectus cutis, seu coloris faciei.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p><p>And this passage of the Old Testament, is well explained by another of
the New<span class="sidenote10"> 2 Cor. 3.</span> wherein it is delivered, that they could not
stedfastly behold the face of <i>Moses</i>, ŒîŒπ·Ω∞ œÑ·Ω¥ŒΩ Œ¥œåŒæŒ±ŒΩ œÑŒø·ø¶ œÄœÅŒøœÉœéœÄŒøœÖ; that
is, for the glory of his countenance. And surely the exposition of one
Text is best performed by another; men vainly interposing their
constructions, where the Scripture decideth the controversie. And
therefore some have seemed too active in their expositions, who in the
story of <i>Rahab</i> the harlot, have given notice that the word also
signifieth an Hostess; for in the Epistle to the <i>Hebrews</i>, she is
plainly termed œÄ·ΩÅœÅŒΩŒ∑, which signifies not an Hostess, but a pecuniary
and prostituting Harlot;<span class="sidenote"><i>What kind of Harlot she was, read</i> Camar.

distinguished from ·ºïœÑŒ±ŒπœÅŒ±, or <i>amica</i>, as may appear in the thirteenth
of <i>Athen√¶us</i>.</p>

<p>And therefore more allowable is the Translation of <i>Tremellius, Quod
splendida facta esset cutis facici ejus</i>; or as <i>Estius</i> hath
interpreted it, <i>facies ejus erat radiosa</i>, his face was radiant, and
dispersing beams like many horns and cones about his head; which is also
consonant unto the original signification, and yet observed in the
pieces of our Saviour, and the Virgin <i>Mary</i>, who are commonly drawn
with scintillations, or radient Halo&rsquo;s about their head; which after the
<i>French</i> expression are usually termed, the Glory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p><p>Now if besides this occasional mistake, any man shall contend a
propriety in this picture, and that no injury is done unto Truth by this
description, because an horn is the Hieroglyphick of authority, power
and dignity, and in this Metaphor is often used in Scripture; the piece
I confess in this acception is harmless and agreeable unto <i>Moses</i>: and
under such emblematical constructions, we find that <i>Alexander</i> the
Great, and <i>Attila</i> King of <i>Hunnes</i>, in ancient Medals are described
with horns. But if from the common mistake, or any solary consideration
we persist in this description, we vilify the mystery of the
irradiation, and authorize a dangerous piece conformable unto that of
<i>Jupiter Hammon</i>; which was the Sun, and therefore described with horns;
as is delivered by <i>Macrobius; Hammonem quem Deum solem occidentem
Lybies existimant, arietinis cornibus fingunt, quibus id animal valet,
sicut radiis sol</i>. We herein also imitate the Picture of <i>Pan</i>, and
<i>Pagan</i> emblem of Nature. And if (as <i>Macrobius</i> and very good Authors
concede) <i>Bacchus</i>, (who is also described with horns) be the same Deity
with the Sun; and if (as <i>Vossius</i> well contendeth<span class="sidenote">Moses <i>and</i>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X_PE_V" id="CHAPTER_X_PE_V">CHAPTER X</a>
<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of the Scutcheons of the Tribes of Israel.</span></h2>


<p>We will not pass over the Scutcheons of the Tribes of <i>Israel</i>, as they
are usually described in the Maps of <i>Canaan</i> and several other pieces;
generally conceived to be the proper coats, and distinctive badges of
their several Tribes. So <i>Reuben</i> is conceived to bear three Bars wave,
<i>Judah</i> a Lyon Rampant, <i>Dan</i> a Serpent nowed, <i>Simeon</i> a sword inpale
the point erected, etc. The ground whereof is the last Benediction of
<i>Jacob</i>,<span class="sidenote10">Gen. 49.</span> wherein he respectively draweth comparisons from
things here represented.</p>

<p>Now herein although we allow a considerable measure of truth, yet
whether as they are usually described, these were the proper
cognizances, and coat-arms of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span> the Tribes; whether in this manner
applyed, and upon the grounds presumed, material doubts remain.</p>

<p>For first, They are not strictly made out, from the Prophetical blessing
of <i>Jacob</i>; for <i>Simeon</i> and <i>Levi</i> have distinct coats, that is, a
Sword, and the two Tables, yet are they by <i>Jacob</i> included in one
Prophesie, <i>Simeon</i> and <i>Levi</i> are brethren, Instruments of cruelties
are in their habitations. So <i>Joseph</i> beareth an Ox, whereof
notwithstanding there is no mention in this Prophesie; for therein it is
said <i>Joseph</i> is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; by
which repitition are intimated the two Tribes descending from him,
<i>Ephraim</i> and <i>Manasses</i>; whereof notwithstanding <i>Ephraim</i> only beareth
an Ox: True it is, that many years after in the benediction of <i>Moses</i>,
it is said of <i>Joseph</i>,<span class="sidenote10">Deut. 33.</span> His glory is like the firstlings
of his Bullock: and so we may concede, what <i>Vossius</i> learnedly
declareth, that the <i>√Ügyptians</i> represented <i>Joseph</i>, in the Symbole of
an Ox; for thereby was best implied the dream of <i>Pharoah</i>, which he
interpreted, the benefit by Agriculture, and provident provision of corn
which he performed; and therefore did <i>Serapis</i> bear a bushel upon his
head.</p>

<p>Again, If we take these two benedictions together, the resemblances are
not appropriate, and <i>Moses</i> therein conforms not unto <i>Jacob</i>: for that
which in the Prophesie of <i>Jacob</i> is appropriated unto one, is in the
blessing of <i>Moses</i> made common unto others. So whereas <i>Judah</i> is
compared unto a Lion by <i>Jacob</i>, <i>Judah</i> is a Lions whelp, the same is
applied unto <i>Dan</i> by <i>Moses</i>, <i>Dan</i> is a Lions whelp, he shall leap
from <i>Bashan</i>, and also unto <i>Gad</i>; he dwelleth as a Lion.</p>

<p>Thirdly, If a lion were the proper coat of <i>Judah</i>, yet were it not
probably a Lion Rampant, as it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span> commonly described, but rather
couchant or dormant, as some <i>Heralds</i> and <i>Rabbins</i> do determine;
according to the letter of the Text, <i>Recumbens dormisti ut Leo</i>, He
couched as a Lion, and as a young Lion, who shall rouse him?</p>

<p>Lastly, when it is said,<span class="sidenote10">Num. 2.</span> Every man of the Children of
<i>Israel</i> shall pitch by his own standard with the Ensign of their
fathers house; upon enquiry what these standards and ensigns were there
is no small incertainty; and men conform not unto the Prophesie of
<i>Jacob</i>. Christian expositors are fain herein to rely upon the
<i>Rabbins</i>, who notwithstanding are various in their traditions, and
confirm not these common descriptions. For as for inferiour ensigns,
either of particular bands or houses, they determine nothing at all; and
of the four principal or Legionary standards, that is, of <i>Judah</i>,
<i>Reuben</i>, <i>Ephraim</i>, and <i>Dan</i> (under every one whereof marched three
Tribes) they explain them very variously. <i>Jonathan</i> who compiled the
Thargum conceives the colours of these banners to answer the precious
stones in the breast-plate, and upon which the names of the Tribes were
engraven. <span class="sidenote"><i>The like also</i> P. Fagius <i>upon the Thargum or</i>
Chaldie <i>Paraphrase of</i> Onkelus. Num. 1.</span> So the standard for the Camp
of <i>Judah</i> was of three colours, according unto the stones, Chalcedony,
Saphir and Sardonix; and therein were expressed the names of the three
Tribes,<span class="sidenote10">Num. 10.</span> <i>Judah</i>, <i>Isachar</i>, and <i>Zabulon</i>, and in the
middest thereof was written, Rise up Lord, and let thy enemies be
scattered, and let them that hate thee flee before thee; in it was also
the pourtrait of a Lion. The standard of <i>Reuben</i> was also of three
colours, Sardine, Topaz, and Amethyst; therein were expressed the names
of <i>Reuben</i>, <i>Simeon</i>, and <i>Gad</i>, in the middest was written,<span class="sidenote10">Deut.
6.</span> Hear, O <i>Israel</i>, The Lord our God, the Lord is one: Therein was
also the pourtraiture of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span> Hart. But <i>Abenezra</i> and others, beside the
colours of the field, do set down other charges, in <i>Reubens</i> the form
of a man or mandrake, in that of <i>Judah</i> a Lion, in <i>Ephraims</i> an Ox, in
<i>Dan&rsquo;s</i> the figure of an Eagle.</p>

<p>And thus indeed the four figures in the banners of the principal
squadrons of <i>Israel</i> are answerable unto the Cherubins in the vision of
<i>Ezekiel</i>;<span class="sidenote10">Ezek. 1.</span> every one carrying the form of all these. As
for the likeness of their faces, they four had the likeness of the face
of a Man, and the face of a Lion on the right side, and they four had
the face of an Ox on the left side, they four had also the face of an
Eagle. <span class="sidenote"><i>The common Pictures of the 4 Evangelists explicated.</i></span> And
conformable hereunto the pictures of the Evangelists (whose Gospels are
the Christian banners) are set forth with the addition of a man or
Angel, an Ox, a Lion, and a Eagle. And these symbolically represent the
office of Angels, and Ministers of Gods Will; in whom is required
understanding as in a man, courage and vivacity as in the Lion, service
and ministerial officiousness, as in the Ox, expedition or celerity of
execution, as in the Eagle.</p>

<p>From hence therefore we may observe that these descriptions, the most
authentick of any, are neither agreeable unto one another, nor unto the
Scutcheons in question. For though they agree in <i>Ephraim</i> and <i>Judah</i>,
that is, the Ox and the Lion, yet do they differ in those of <i>Dan</i>, and
<i>Reuben</i>, as far as an Eagle is different from a Serpent, and the figure
of a Man, Hart, or Mandrake, from three Bars wave. <span class="sidenote"><i>The Antiquity
of bearing Scutcheons.</i></span> Wherein notwithstanding we rather declare the
incertainty of Arms in this particular, than any way question their
antiquity; for hereof more ancient examples there are, than the
Scutcheons of the Tribes, if <i>Osyris</i>, <i>Mizraim</i> or <i>Jupiter</i> the Just,
were the Son of <i>Cham</i>; for of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span> two Sons, as <i>Diodorus</i> delivereth,
the one for his Device gave a Dog, the other a Wolf. And, beside the
shield of <i>Achilles</i>, and many ancient <i>Greeks</i>: if we receive the
conjecture of <i>Vossius</i>, that the Crow upon <i>Corvinus</i> his head, was but
the figure of that Animal upon his helmet, it is an example of Antiquity
among the <i>Romans</i>.</p>

<p>But more widely must we walk, if we follow the doctrine of the
<i>Cabalists</i><span class="sidenote"><i>Ricius</i><a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>

each of the four banners inscribe a letter of the Tetragrammaton, or

particular ones of the twelve Tribes, accommodable unto the twelve signs

<i>Persica</i>. In which enumeration I perceive learned <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>men are not
satisfied, and many conclude an irreconcilable incertainty; some making
more, others fewer, and not this certain number. For <i>Suidas</i>, though he
affirm that in divers ages there were ten, yet the same denomination he
affordeth unto more; <i>Boysardus</i> in his Tract of Divination hath set
forth the Icons of these Ten, yet addeth two others, <i>Epirotica</i>, and
<i>√Ügyptia</i>; and some affirm that Prophesying women were generally named
<i>Sibyls</i>.</p>

<p>Others make them fewer: <i>Martianus Capella</i> two; <i>Pliny</i> and <i>Solinus</i>
three; <i>√Ülian</i> four; and <i>Salmasius</i> in effect but seven. For
discoursing hereof in his <i>Plinian</i> Exercitations, he thus determineth;
<i>Ridere licet hodiernos Pictores, qui tabulas proponunt Cuman√¶, Cume√¶,
et Erythr√¶√¶, quasi trium diversarum Sibyllarum; cum una cademque fuerit
Cumana, Cum√¶a, et Erythr√¶a, ex plurium et doctissimorum Authorum
sententia.</i> <i>Boysardus</i> gives us leave to opinion there was no more than
one; for so doth he conclude, <i>In tanta Scriptorum varietate liberum
relinquimus Lectori credere, an una et eadem in diversis regionibus
peregrinata, cognomen sortita sit ab iis locis ubi oracula reddidisse
comperitur, an plures extiterint</i>: And therefore not discovering a
resolution of their number from pens of the best Writers, we have no
reason to determine the same from the hand and pencil of Painters.</p>

<p>As touching their age, that they are generally described as young women,
History will not allow; for the Sibyl whereof <i>Virgil</i> speaketh is
termed by him <i>long√¶va sacerdos</i>, and <i>Servius</i> in his Comment
amplifieth the same. The other that sold the books unto <i>Tarquin</i>, and
whose History is plainer than any, by <i>Livie</i> and <i>Gellius</i> is termed
<i>Anus</i>; that is, properly no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span> woman of ordinary age, but full of years,
and in the dayes of dotage, according to the Etymology of <i>Festus</i>;
<span class="sidenote">Anus, quasi ·ºàno·ø¶s, sine mente.</span> and consonant unto the History; wherein
it is said, that <i>Tarquin</i> thought she doted with old age. Which duly
perpended, the <i>Licentia pictoria</i> is very large; with the same reason
they may delineate old <i>Nestor</i> like <i>Adonis</i>, <i>Hecuba</i> with <i>Helens</i>
face, and Time with <i>Absolons</i> head. But this absurdity that eminent
Artist <i>Michael Angelo</i> hath avoided, in the Pictures of the <i>Cumean</i>
and <i>Persian</i> Sibyls, as they stand described from the printed
sculptures of <i>Adam Mantuanus</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII_PE_V" id="CHAPTER_XII_PE_V">CHAPTER XII</a>
<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of the Picture describing the death of <i>Cleopatra</i>.</span></h2>


<p>The Picture concerning the death of <i>Cleopatra</i> with two Asps or
venemous Serpents unto her arms, or breasts, or both, requires
consideration: for therein (beside that this variety is not excusable)
the thing it self is questionable; nor is it indisputably certain what
manner of death she died. <i>Plutarch</i> in the life of <i>Antony</i> plainly
delivereth, that no man knew the manner of her death; for some affirmed
she perished by poison, which she alwayes carried in a little hollow
comb, and wore it in her hair. Beside, there were never any Asps
discovered in the place of her death, although two of her maids perished
also with her; only it was said, two small and almost insensible pricks
were found upon her arm; which was all the ground that <i>C√¶sar</i> had to
presume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span> the manner of her death. <i>Galen</i> who was contemporary unto
<i>Plutarch</i>, delivereth two wayes of her death: that she killed her self
by the bite of an Asp, or bit an hole in her arm, and poured poison
therein. <i>Strabo</i> that lived before them both hath also two opinions;
that she died by the bite of an Asp, or else a poisonous ointment.</p>

<p>We might question the length of the Asps, which are sometimes described
exceeding short; whereas the Chers√¶a or land-Asp which most conceive she
used, is above four cubits long. Their number is not unquestionable; for
whereas there are generally two described, <i>Augustus</i> (as <i>Plutarch</i>
relateth) did carry in his triumph the Image of <i>Cleopatra</i> but with one
Asp under her arm. As for the two pricks, or little spots in her arm,
they infer not their plurality: for like the Viper, the Asp hath two
teeth; whereby it left this impression, or double puncture behind it.</p>

<p>And lastly, We might question the place; for some apply them unto her
breast, which notwithstanding will not consist with the History; and
<i>Petrus Victorius</i> hath well observed the same. But herein the mistake
was easie; it being the custom in capital malefactors to apply them unto
the breast, as the Author <i>De Theriaca ad Pisonem</i>, an eye witness
hereof in <i>Alexandria</i>, where <i>Cleopatra</i> died, determineth: I beheld,
saith he, in <i>Alexandria</i>, how suddenly these Serpents bereave a man of
life; for when any one is condemned to this kind of death, if they
intend to use him favourably, that is, to dispatch him suddenly, they
fasten an Asp unto his breast; and bidding him walk about, he presently
perisheth thereby.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII_PE_V" id="CHAPTER_XIII_PE_V">CHAPTER XIII</a>
<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of the Pictures of the Nine Worthies.</span></h2>


<p>The Pictures of the nine Worthies are not unquestionable, and to
critical spectators may seem to contain sundry improprieties. Some will
enquire why <i>Alexander</i> the Great is described upon an Elephant: for, we
do not find he used that animal in his armies, much less in his own
person; but his horse is famous in History, and its name alive to this
day. Beside, he fought but one remarkable battel, wherein there were any
Elephants, and that was with <i>Porus</i> King of <i>India</i>; in which
notwithstanding, as <i>Curtius</i>, <i>Arrianus</i>, and <i>Plutarch</i> report, he was
on Horseback himself. And if because he fought against Elephants, he is
with propriety set upon their backs; with no less or greater reason is
the same description agreeable unto <i>Judas Maccabeus</i>, as may be
observed from the history of the <i>Maccabees</i>; and also unto <i>Julius
C√¶sar</i>, whose triumph was honoured with captive Elephants, as may be
observed in the order thereof, set forth by <i>Jacobus Laurus</i>. <span class="sidenote">In
splendere urbis Antiqu√¶.</span> And if also we should admit this description
upon an Elephant, yet were not the manner thereof unquestionable, that
is, in his ruling the beast alone; for beside the Champion upon their
back, there was also a guide or ruler, which sat more forward to command
or guide the beast. Thus did King <i>Porus</i> ride when he was overthrown by
<i>Alexander</i>; and thus are also the towred Elephants described, <i>Maccab.</i>
2. 6. Upon the beasts there were strong towers of wood, which covered
every one of them, and were girt fast unto them by devices: there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span> were
also upon every one of them thirty two strong men, beside the <i>Indian</i>
that ruled them.</p>

<p>Others will demand, not only why <i>Alexander</i> upon an Elephant, but
<i>Hector</i> upon an Horse: whereas his manner of fighting, or presenting
himself in battel, was in a Chariot, as did the other noble <i>Trojans</i>,
who as <i>Pliny</i> affirmeth were the first inventers thereof. The same way
of fight is testified by <i>Diodorus</i>, and thus delivered by Sir <i>Walter
Rawleigh</i>. Of the vulgar little reckoning was made, for they fought all
on foot, slightly armed, and commonly followed the success of their
Captains; who rode not upon horses, but in Chariots drawn by two or
three Horses. And this was also the ancient way of fight among the
<i>Britains</i>, as is delivered by <i>Diodorus</i>, <i>C√¶sar</i>, and <i>Tacitus</i>; and
there want not some who have taken advantage hereof, and made it one
argument of their original from <i>Troy</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The use of stirrops not ancient.</i></div>

<p>Lastly, By any man versed in Antiquity, the question can hardly be
avoided, why the Horses of these Worthies, especially of <i>C√¶sar</i>, are
described with the furniture of great saddles, and stirrops; for saddles
largely taken, though some defence there may be, yet that they had not
the use of stirrops, seemeth of lesser doubt; as <i>Pancirollus</i> hath
observed, as <i>Polydore Virgil</i>, and <i>Petrus Victorius</i> have
confirmed,<span class="sidenote">De inventione rerum, vari√¶ Lectiones.</span> expresly
discoursing hereon; as is observable from <i>Pliny</i>, and cannot escape our
eyes in the ancient monuments, medals and Triumphant arches of the
<i>Romans</i>. Nor is there any ancient classical word in Latine to express
them. For <i>Staphia</i>, <i>Stapes</i> or <i>Stapeda</i> is not to be found in Authors
of this Antiquity. And divers words which may be urged of this
signification, are either later, or signified not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span> thus much in the time
of <i>C√¶sar</i>. And therefore as <i>Lipsius</i> observeth, lest a thing of common
use should want a common word, <i>Franciscus Philelphus</i> named them
<i>Stapedas</i>, and <i>Bodinus Subicus</i> Pedaneos. And whereas the name might
promise some Antiquity, because among the three small bones in the
Auditory Organ, by Physitians termed <i>Incus</i>, <i>Malleus</i> and <i>stapes</i>,
one thereof from some resemblance doth bear this name; these bones were
not observed, much less named by <i>Hippocrates</i>, <i>Galen</i>, or any ancient
Physitian. But as <i>Laurentius</i> observeth, concerning the invention of
the stapes or stirrop bone, there is some contention between <i>Columbus</i>
and <i>Ingrassias</i>; the one of <i>Sicilia</i>, the other of <i>Cremona</i>, and both
within the compass of this Century.</p>

<p>The same is also deduceable from very approved Authors: <i>Polybius</i>
speaking of the way which <i>Anibal</i> marched into <i>Italy</i>, useth the word
Œ≤ŒµŒ≤Œ∑ŒºŒ¨œÑŒπœÉœÑŒ±Œπ, that is, saith <i>Petrus Victorius</i>, it was stored with
devices for men to get upon their horses, which ascents were termed
<i>Bemata</i>, and in the life of <i>Caius Gracchus</i>, <i>Plutarch</i> expresseth as
much. For endevouring to ingratiate himself with the people, besides the
placing of stones at every miles end, he made at nearer distances
certain elevated places, and Scalary ascents, that by the help thereof
they might with better ease ascend or mount their Horses. Now if we
demand how Cavaliers then destitute of stirrops did usually mount their
Horses; as <i>Lipsius</i> informeth the unable and softer sort of men had
their ·ºÄŒΩŒ±Œ≤ŒøŒªŒµ·øñœÇ, or Stratores, which helped them up on horse back, as in
the practice of <i>Crassus</i> in <i>Plutarch</i>, and <i>Caracalla</i> in
<i>Spartianus</i>, and the later example of <i>Valentinianus</i>, who because his
horse rised before that he could not be setled on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span> his back, cut off the
right hand of his Strator. But how the active and hardy persons mounted,
<i>Vegetius</i> <span class="sidenote15">De re Milit.</span> resolves us, that they used to vault or
leap up, and therefore they had wooden horses in their houses and
abroad: that thereby young men might enable themselves in this action:
wherein by instruction and practice they grew so perfect, that they
could vault up on the right or left, and that with their sword in hand,
according to that of <i>Virgil</i></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="line"><i>Poscit equos atque arma simul, saltuque superbus Emicat.</i></div>
</div></div>

<p>And again:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="line"><i>Infr√¶nant alii currus et corpora saltu</i></div>
<div class="line"><i>Injiciunt in equos.</i></div>
</div></div>

<p>So <i>Julius Pollux</i> adviseth to teach horses to incline, dimit, and bow
down their bodies, that their riders may with better ease ascend them.
And thus may it more causally be made out, what <i>Hippocrates</i> affirmeth
of the <i>Scythians</i>, that using continual riding, they were generally
molested with the Sciatica or hip-gout. Or what <i>Suetonius</i> delivereth
of <i>Germanicus</i>, that he had slender legs, but encreased them by riding
after meals; that is, the humours descending upon their pendulosity,
they having no support or suppedaneous stability.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p><p>Now if any shall say that these are petty errors and minor lapses, not
considerably injurious unto truth, yet is it neither reasonable nor fair
to contemn inferiour falsities; but rather as between falshood and truth
there is no medium, so should they be maintained in their distances: nor
the contagion of the one, approach the sincerity of the other.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV_PE_V" id="CHAPTER_XIV_PE_V">CHAPTER XIV</a>
<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of the Picture of <i>Jephthah</i> sacryficing his daughter.</span></h2>


<div class="sidenote"><i>That</i> Jephthah <i>did not kill his daughter</i>.</div>

<p>The hand of the Painter confidently setteth forth the Picture of
<i>Jephthah</i> in the posture of <i>Abraham</i>, sacrificing his only daughter:
Thus is it commonly received, and hath had the attest of many worthy
Writers. Notwithstanding upon enquiry we find the matter doubtful, and
many upon probable grounds to have been of another opinion: conceiving
in this oblation not a natural but a civil kind of death, and a
separation only unto the Lord. <span class="sidenote15">Judg. 11.39</span>For that he pursued not his vow unto a
literal oblation, there want not arguments both from the Text and
reason.</p>

<p>For first, It is evident that she deplored her Virginity, and not her
death; Let me go up and down the mountains, and bewail my Virginity, I
and my fellows.</p>

<p>Secondly, When it is said, that <i>Jephthah</i> did unto her according unto
his vow, it is immediately subjoyned, <i>Et non cognovit virum</i>, and she
knew no man; which as immediate in words, was probably most near in
sense unto the vow.</p>

<p>Thirdly, It is said in the Text, that the daughters of <i>Israel</i> went
yearly to talk with the daughter of <i>Jephthah</i> four dayes in the year;
which had she been sacrificed, they could not have done: For whereas the
word is sometime translated to lament, yet doth it also signifie to talk
or have conference with one, and by <i>Tremellius</i>, who was well able to
Judge of the Original, it is in this sense translated: <i>Ibant filii<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
Israelitarum, ad confabulandum cum filia Jephthaci, quatuor diebus
quotannis</i>: And so it is also set down in the marginal notes of our
Translation. And from this annual concourse of the daughters of
<i>Israel</i>, it is not improbable in future Ages, the daughter of
<i>Jephthah</i> came to be worshipped as a Deity; and had by the <i>Samaritans</i>
an annual festivity observed unto her honour, as <i>Epiphanius</i> hath left
recorded in the Heresie of the <i>Melchidecians</i>.</p>

<p>It is also repugnant unto reason; for the offering of mankind was
against the Law of God, who so abhorred humane sacrifice, that he
omitted not the oblation of unclean beasts, and confined his Altars but
unto few kinds of Animals, the Ox, the Goat, the Sheep, the Pigeon and
its kinds: In the cleansing of the Leper, there is I confess, mention
made of the Sparrow; but great dispute may be made whether it be
properly rendered. And therefore the Scripture with indignation
oft-times makes mention of humane sacrifice among the <i>Gentiles</i>; whose
oblations scarce made scruple of any Animal, sacrificing not only Man,
but Horses, Lions, √Ügles; and though they come not into holocausts, yet
do we read the <i>Syrians</i> did make oblations of fishes unto the goddess
<i>Derceto</i>. It being therefore a sacrifice so abominable unto God,
although he had pursued it, it is not probable the Priests and Wisdom of
<i>Israel</i> would have permitted it; and that not only in regard of the
subject or sacrifice it self, but also the sacrificator, which the
Picture makes to be <i>Jephthah</i>; who was neither Priest, nor capable of
that Office: for he was a <i>Gileadite</i>, and as the Text affirmeth, the
son also of an harlot. And how hardly the Priesthood would endure
encroachment upon their function, a notable example there is in the
story of <i>Ozias</i>.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>Secondly, The offering up of his daughter was not only unlawful, and
entrenched upon his Religion, but had been a course that had much
condemned his discretion; that is, to have punished himself in the
strictest observance of his vow, when as the Law of God had allowed an
evasion; that is, by way of commutation or redemption, according as is
determined, <i>Levit.</i> 27. Whereby if she were between the age of five and
twenty, she was to be estimated but at ten shekels, and if between
twenty and sixty, not above thirty. A sum that could never discourage an
indulgent Parent; it being but the value of servant slain; the
inconsiderable Salary of <i>Judas</i>; and will make no greater noise than
three pound fifteen shillings with us. And therefore their conceit is
not to be exploded, who say that from the story of <i>Jephthah</i>
sacrificing his own daughter, might spring the fable of <i>Agamemnon</i>,
delivering unto sacrifice his daughter <i>Iphigenia</i>, who was also
contemporary unto <i>Jephthah</i>: wherein to answer the ground that hinted
it, <i>Iphigenia</i> was not sacrificed her self, but redeemed with an Hart,
which <i>Diana</i> accepted for her.</p>

<p>Lastly, Although his vow run generally for the words, Whatsoever shall
come forth, etc. Yet might it be restrained in the sense, for whatsoever
was sacrificable, and justly subject to lawful immolation: and so would
not have sacrificed either Horse or Dog, if they had come out upon him.
Nor was he obliged by oath unto a strict observation of that which
promissorily was unlawful; or could he be qualified by vow to commit a
fact which naturally was abominable. Which doctrine had <i>Herod</i>
understood, it might have saved <i>John Baptists</i> head; when he promised
by oath to give unto <i>Herodias</i> whatsoever she would ask; that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span> is, if
it were in the compass of things, which he could lawfully grant. For his
oath made not that lawful which was illegal before: and if it were
unjust to murther <i>John</i>, the supervenient Oath did not extenuate the
fact, or oblige the Juror unto it.</p>

<p>Now the ground at least which much promoted the opinion, might be the
dubious words of the text, which contain the sense of his vow; most men
adhering unto their common and obvious acception. Whatsoever shall come
forth of the doors of my house shall surely be the Lords, and I will
offer it up for a burnt offering. Now whereas it is said, <i>Erit Jehov√¶,
et offeram illud holocaustum</i>, the word signifying both <i>et</i> and <i>aut</i>,
it may be taken disjunctively; <i>aut offeram</i>, that is, it shall either
be the Lords by separation, or else, an holocaust by common oblation;
even as our marginal translation advertiseth; and as <i>Tremellius</i>
rendreth it, <i>Erit inquam Jehov√¶, aut offeram illud holocaustum</i>: and
for the vulgar translation, it useth often <i>et</i>, where <i>aut</i> must be
presumed, as <i>Exod.</i> 21. <i>Si quis percusserit patrem et matrem</i>, that
is, not both, but either. There being therefore two waies to dispose of
her, either to separate her unto the Lord, or offer her as a sacrifice,
it is of no necessity the later should be necessary; and surely less
derogatory unto the sacred text and history of the people of God, must
be the former.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV_PE_V" id="CHAPTER_XV_PE_V">CHAPTER XV</a>
<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of the Picture of <i>John</i> the Baptist.</span></h2>


<p>The Picture of <i>John</i> the Baptist, in a Camels skin is very
questionable, and many I perceive have condemned it. The ground or
occasion of this description are the words of the holy Scripture,
especially of <i>Matthew</i> and <i>Mark</i>, for <i>Luke</i> and <i>John</i> are silent
herein; by them it is delivered, his garment was of Camels hair, and had
a leather girdle about his loins. Now here it seems the Camels hair is
taken by Painters for the skin or pelt with the hair upon it. But this
Exposition will not so well consist with the strict acceptation of the
words; for <i>Mark</i> 1. It is said, he was, ·ºêŒΩŒ¥ŒµŒ¥œÖŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒøœÇ œÑœÅŒØœáŒ±œÇ
Œ∫Œ±ŒºŒÆŒªŒøœÖ, and <i>Matthew</i> 3. Œµ·º∂œáŒµ œÑ·Ω∏ ·ºîŒΩŒ¥œÖŒºŒ± ·ºÄœÄ·Ω∏ œÑœÅŒπœá·ø∂ŒΩ Œ∫Œ±ŒºŒÆŒªŒøœÖ,
that is, as the vulgar translation, that of <i>Beza</i>, that of <i>Sixtus
Quintus</i>, and <i>Clement</i> the eight hath rendred it, <i>vestimentum habebat
√® pilis camelinis</i>; which is as ours translateth it, a garment of Camels
hair; that is, made of some texture of that hair, a course garment; a
cilicious or sackcloth habit; sutable to the austerity of his life; the
severity of his Doctrine, Repentance; and the place thereof, the
wilderness, his food and diet, locusts and wild hony. <span class="sidenote15">2 Kings 3. 18.</span> Agreeable unto the
example of <i>Elias</i>, who is said to be <i>vir pilosus</i>,
that is, as <i>Tremellius</i> interprets, <i>Veste villosa<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> cinctus</i>,
answerable unto the habit of the ancient Prophets, according to that of
<i>Zachary</i>. <span class="sidenote10">Zach. 13.</span> In that day the Prophets shall be ashamed,
neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive; and sutable to the
Cilicious and hairy <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>Vests of the strictest Orders of Fryers, who derive
the institution of their Monastick life from the example of <i>John</i> and
<i>Elias</i>.</p>

<p>As for the wearing of skins, where that is properly intended, the
expression of the Scripture is plain; so it is said, <i>Heb.</i> 11. They
wandered about ·ºêŒΩ Œ±·º∞Œ≥ŒµŒØŒøŒπœÇ Œ¥Œ≠œÅŒºŒ±œÉŒπŒΩ, that is, in Goats skins; and so it
is said of our first Parents, <i>Gen.</i> 3. That God made them œáŒπœÑ·ø∂ŒΩŒ±œÇ
Œ¥ŒµœÅŒºŒ±œÑŒØŒΩŒøœÖœÇ, <i>Vestes pelliceas</i>, or coats of skins; which though a
natural habit unto all, before the invention of Texture, was something
more unto <i>Adam</i>, who had newly learned to die; for unto him a garment
from the dead, was but a dictate of death, and an habit of mortality.</p>

<p>Now if any man will say this habit of <i>John</i> was neither of Camels skin,
nor any course Texture of its hair, but rather some finer Weave of
Camelot, Grograin or the like, in as much as these stuffs are supposed
to be made of the hair of that Animal, or because that <i>√Ülian</i>
affirmeth, that Camels hair of <i>Persia</i>, is as fine as <i>Milesian</i> wool,
wherewith the great ones of that place were cloathed; they have
discovered an habit, not only unsutable unto his leathern cincture, and
the coarseness of his life; but not consistent with the words of our
Saviour, when reasoning with the people concerning <i>John</i>, he saith,
What went you out into the wilderness to see? a man clothed in soft
raiment? Behold, they that wear soft raiment, are in Kings houses.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI_PE_V" id="CHAPTER_XVI_PE_V">CHAPTER XVI</a>
<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of the Picture of St. <i>Christopher</i>.</span></h2>


<p>The Picture of St. <i>Christopher</i>, that is, a man of a Giantlike stature,
bearing upon his shoulders our Saviour Christ, and with a staff in his
hand, wading thorow the water, is known unto Children, common over all
<i>Europe</i>, not only as a sign unto houses, but is described in many
Churches, and stands <i>Colossus</i> like in the entrance of <i>Nostre Dame</i> in
<i>Paris</i>.</p>

<p>Now from hence, common eyes conceive an history sutable unto this
description, that he carried our Saviour in his Minority over some river
or water: which notwithstanding we cannot at all make out. For we read
not thus much in any good Author, nor of any remarkable <i>Christopher</i>,
before the reign of <i>Decius</i>: who lived 250 years after Christ. This man
indeed according unto History suffered as a Martyr in the second year of
that Emperour, and in the <i>Roman</i> Calendar takes up the 21 of <i>July</i>.</p>

<p>The ground that begat or promoted this opinion, was, first the fabulous
adjections of succeeding ages unto the veritable acts of this Martyr,
who in the most probable accounts was remarkable for his staff, and a
man of a goodly stature.</p>

<p>The second might be a mistake or misapprehension of the Picture, most
men conceiving that an History which was contrived at first but as an

<i>Christopher</i> are depraved by many: which surely began from no other
ground, then, that in process of time, unskilful men translated
symbolical figures unto real verities: and therefore what is usually
described in the Picture of St. <i>Christopher</i>, is rather to be received
as an Emblem, or Symbolical description, then any real History. Now what
Emblem this was, or what its signification, conjectures are many;
<i>Pierius</i> hath set down one, that is, of the Disciple of Christ; for he
that will carry Christ upon his shoulders, must rely upon the staff of
his direction, whereon if he firmeth himself, he may be able to overcome
the billows of resistance, and in the vertue of this staff, like that of
<i>Jacob</i>, pass over the waters of <i>Jordan</i>. Or otherwise thus; He that
will submit shoulders unto Christ, shall by the concurrence of his power
encrease into the strength of a Giant; and being supported by the staff
of his holy Spirit, shall not be overwhelmed by the waves of the world,
but wade through all resistance.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII_PE_V" id="CHAPTER_XVII_PE_V">CHAPTER XVII</a>
<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of the Picture of St. <i>George</i>.</span></h2>


<p>The Picture of St. <i>George</i> killing the Dragon, and, as most ancient
draughts do run, with the daughter of a King standing by, is famous
amongst Christians. And upon this description dependeth a solemn story,
how by this atchievement he redeemed a Kings daughter: which is more
especially believed by the <i>English</i>, whose Protector he is: and in
which form and history, according to his description in the <i>English</i>
Colledge at <i>Rome</i>, he is set forth in the Icons or Cuts of Martyrs by
<i>Cevalerius</i>: and all this according to the <i>Historia Lombardica</i>, or
golden legend of <i>Jacobus de Voragine</i>. Now of what authority soever
this piece be amongst us, it is I perceive received with different
beliefs: for some believe the person and the story; some the person, but
not the story; and others deny both.</p>

<p>That such a person there was, we shall not contend: for besides others,
Dr. <i>Heilin</i> hath clearly asserted it in his History of St. <i>George</i>.
The indistinction of many in the community of name, or the
misapplication of the acts of one unto another, hath made some doubt
thereof. For of this name we meet with more then one in History, and no
less then two conceived of <i>Cappadocia</i>. The one an <i>Arrian</i>, who was
slain by the <i>Alexandrians</i> in the time of <i>Julian</i>; the other a
valiant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span> Souldier and Christian Martyr, beheaded in the reign of
<i>Dioclesian</i>. This is the <i>George</i> conceived in this Picture, who hath
his day in the <i>Roman</i> Calender, on whom so many fables are delivered,
whose story is set forth by <i>Metaphrastes</i>, and his miracles by
<i>Turonensis</i>.</p>

<p>As for the story depending hereon, some conceive as lightly thereof, as
of that of <i>Persius</i> and <i>Andromeda</i>; conjecturing the one to be the
father of the other; and some too highly assert it. Others with better
moderation, do either entertain the same as a fabulous addition unto the
true and authentick story of St. <i>George</i>; or else conceive the literal
acception to be a misconstruction of the symbolical expression;
apprehending a veritable History, in an Emblem or piece of Christian
Poesie. And this Emblematical construction hath been received by men not
forward to extenuate the acts of Saints: as from <i>Baronius</i>, <i>Lipellous</i>
the <i>Carthusian</i> hath delivered in the life of St. <i>George</i>; <i>Picturam
illam St.</i> Georgii <i>qu√¢ effingitur eques armatus, qui hast√¶ cuspide
hostem interficit, juxta quam etiam virgo posita manus supplices tendens
ejus explorat auxilium, Symboli potius quam histori√¶ alicujus censenda
expressa imago. Consuevit quidem ut equestris militi√¶ miles equestri
imagine referri</i>: that is, The Picture of St. <i>George</i>, wherein he is
described like a Curassier or horseman compleatly armed, etc. Is rather
a symbolical image, then any proper figure.</p>

<p>Now in the Picture of this Saint and Souldier, might be implied the
Christian Souldier and true Champion of Christ. A horseman armed <i>Cap a
pe</i>, intimating the <i>Panoplia</i> or compleat armour of a Christian;
combating with the Dragon, that is, with the Devil; in defence of the
Kings daughter, that is, the Church of God. And therefore although the
history be not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span> made out, it doth not disparage the Knights and Noble
order of St. <i>George</i>: whose cognisance is honourable in the Emblem of
the Souldier of Christ, and is a worthy memorial to conform unto its
mystery. Nor, were there no such person at all, had they more reason to
be ashamed, then the Noble order of <i>Burgundy</i>, and Knights of the
Golden Fleece; whose badge is a confessed fable.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII_PE_V" id="CHAPTER_XVIII_PE_V">CHAPTER XVIII</a>
<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of the Picture of <i>Jerom</i>.</span></h2>


<div class="sidenote"><i>Clocks no very ancient invention.</i></div>

<p>The Picture of <i>Jerom</i> usually described at his study, with a Clock
hanging by, is not to be omitted; for though the meaning be allowable,
and probable it is that industrious Father did not let slip his time
without account; yet must not perhaps that Clock be set down to have
been his measure thereof. For Clocks or Automatous organs, whereby we
now distinguish of time, have found no mention in any ancient Writers
but are of late invention, as <i>Pancirollus</i> observeth. And <i>Polydore
Virgil</i> discoursing of new inventions whereof the authors are not known,
makes instance in Clocks and Guns. Now <i>Jerom</i> is no late Writer, but
one of the ancient Fathers, and lived in the fourth Century, in the
reign of <i>Theodosius</i> the first.</p>

<p>It is not to be denied that before the daies of <i>Jerom</i> there were
Horologies, and several accounts of time; for they measured the hours
not only by drops of water in glasses called Clepsydr√¶, but also by sand
in glasses called Clepsammia. There were also from great antiquity,
Scioterical or Sun Dials, by the shadow of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span> a stile or gnomon denoting
the hours of the day: an invention ascribed unto <i>Anaximines</i> by
<i>Pliny</i>. Hereof a memorable one there was in <i>Campus Martius</i>, from an
obelisk erected, and golden figures placed horozontally about it; which
was brought out of <i>Egypt</i> by <i>Augustus</i>, and described by <i>Jacobus
Laurus</i>. And another of great antiquity we meet with in the story of
<i>Ezechias</i>; for so it is delivered in <i>King.</i> 2. 20. That the Lord
brought the shadow backward ten degrees by which it had gone down in the
dial of Ahaz. <span class="sidenote"><i>A peculiar description and particular construction
hereof out of</i> R. Chomer, <i>is set down</i>, Curios de Caffarel. chap. 9.</span>
That is, say some, ten degrees, not lines; for the hours were denoted by
certain divisions or steps in the Dial, which others distinguished by
lines, according to that of <i>Persius</i></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="line"><i>Stertimus indomitum quod despumare Falernum</i></div>
<div class="line indent2"><i>Sufficiat, quint√¢ dum linea tangitur umbra.</i></div>
</div></div>

<p>That is, the line next the Meridian, or within an hour of noon.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Doctrine of circular motions.</i></div>

<p>Of later years there succeeded new inventions, and horologies composed
by Trochilick or the artifice of wheels; whereof some are kept in motion
by weight, others perform without it. Now as one age instructs another,
and time that brings all things to ruin, perfects also every thing; so
are these indeed of more general and ready use then any that went before
them. By the Water-glasses the account was not regular: for from
attenuation and condensation, whereby that Element is altered, the hours
were shorter in hot weather then in cold, and in Summer then in Winter.
As for Scioterical Dials, whether of the Sun or Moon, they are only of
use in the actual radiation of those Luminaries, and are of little
advantage unto those inhabitants, which for many months enjoy not the
Lustre of the Sun.</p>

<p>It is I confess no easie wonder how the horometry of Antiquity
discovered not this Artifice, how <i>Architas</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span> that contrived the moving
Dove, or rather the <i>Helicosophie</i> of <i>Archimedes</i>, fell not upon this
way. Surely as in many things, so in this particular, the present age
hath far surpassed Antiquity; whose ingenuity hath been so bold not only
to proceed below the account of minutes, but to attempt perpetual
motions, and engines whose revolutions (could their substance answer the
design) might out-last the exemplary mobility, and out measure time it
self. For such a one is that mentioned by <i>John Dee</i>, whose words are
these in his learned Preface unto <i>Euclide</i>: By Wheels strange works and
incredible are done: A wondrous example was seen in my time in a certain
Instrument, which by the Inventer and Artificer was sold for twenty
talents of gold; and then by chance had received some injury, and one
<i>Janellus</i> of <i>Cremona</i> did mend the same, and presented it unto the
Emperor <i>Charles</i> the fift. <i>Jeronimus Cardanus</i> can be my witness, that
therein was one Wheel that moved at such a rate, that in seven thousand
years his own period should be finished; a thing almost incredible, but
how far I keep within my bounds, many men yet alive can tell.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX_PE_V" id="CHAPTER_XIX_PE_V">CHAPTER XIX</a>
<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of the Pictures of <i>Mermaids</i>, <i>Unicorns</i>,
and some others.</span></h2>


<p>Few eyes have escaped the Picture of <i>Mermaids</i>: that is, according to
<i>Horace</i> his Monster, with womans head above, and fishy extremity below;
and these are conceived to answer the shape of the ancient <i>Syrens</i> that
attempted upon <i>Ulysses</i>. Which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span> notwithstanding were of another
description, containing no fishy composure, but made up of Man and Bird;
the humane mediety variously placed not only above, but below; according
unto <i>√Ülian</i>, <i>Suidas</i>, <i>Servius</i>, <i>Boccatius</i>, and <i>Aldrovandus</i>, who
hath referred their description unto the story of fabulous Birds;
according to the description of Ovid, and the account thereof in
Hyginus, that they were the daughters of <i>Melpomene</i>, and metamorphosed
into the shape of man and bird by <i>Ceres</i>.</p>

<p>And therefore these pieces so common among us, do rather derive their
original, or are indeed the very description of <i>Dagon</i>;<span class="sidenote"><i>Dagon the
Idol, of what form.</i></span> which was made with human figure above, and fishy
shape below; whose stump, or as <i>Tremellius</i> and our margin renders it,
whose fishy part only remained, when the hands and upper part fell
before the Ark.<span class="sidenote10">1 Sam. 5.</span> Of the shape of <i>Artergates</i>, or
<i>Derceto</i> with the <i>Ph≈ìnitians</i>; in whose fishy and feminine mixture,
as some conceive, were implied the Moon and the Sea, or the Deity of the
waters; and therefore, in their sacrifices, they made oblations of
fishes. From whence were probably occasioned the Pictures of <i>Nereides</i>
and <i>Tritons</i> among the <i>Grecians</i>, and such as we read in <i>Macrobius</i>,
to have been placed on the top of the Temple of <i>Saturn</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p><p>We are unwilling to question the Royal Supporters of <i>England</i>, that is,
the approved descriptions of the Lion and the Unicorn. Although, if in
the Lion, the position of the pizel be proper, and that the natural
situation; it will be hard to make out their retro-copulation, or their
coupling and pissing backward, according to the determination of
<i>Aristotle</i>; All that urine backward do copulate œÄœÖŒ≥Œ∑Œ¥·Ω∏ŒΩ <i>clunatim</i>, or
aversly, as Lions, Hares, Linxes.</p>

<p>As for the Unicorn, if it have the head of a Deer, and the tail of a
Boar, as <i>Vartomannus</i> describeth it, how agreeable it is to this
picture every eye may discern. If it be made bisulcous or cloven footed,
it agreeth unto the description of <i>Vartommanus</i>, but scarce of any
other; and <i>Aristotle</i> supposeth that such as divide the hoof, do also
double the horn; they being both of the same nature, and admitting
division together. And lastly if the horn have this situation and be so
forwardly affixed, as is described, it will not be easily conceived, how
it can feed from the ground; and therefore we observe, that Nature in
other cornigerous animals, hath placed the horns higher and reclining,
as in Bucks; in some inverted upwards, as in the Rhinoceros, the
<i>Indian</i> Ass, and Unicornous Beetles; and thus have some affirmed it is
seated in this animal.</p>

<p>We cannot but observe that in the Picture of <i>Jonah</i> and others, Whales
are described with two prominent spouts on their heads; whereas indeed
they have but one in the forehead, and terminating over the wind-pipe.
Nor can we overlook the Picture of Elephants with Castles on their
backs, made in the form of land Castles, or stationary fortifications,
and answerable unto the Arms of <i>Castile</i>, or Sir <i>John</i> Old Castle;
whereas the towers they bore were made of wood, and girt unto their
bodies; as is delivered in the books of <i>Maccabees</i>, and as they were
appointed in the Army of <i>Antiochus</i>.</p>

<p>We will not dispute the Pictures of Retiary Spiders, and their position
in the web, which is commonly made lateral, and regarding the Horizon;
although, if observed, we shall commonly find it downward, and their
heads respecting the Center. <span class="sidenote"><i>Where the seven Stars be situated.</i></span>
We will not controvert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span> the Picture of the seven Stars; although if
thereby be meant the Pleiades, or subconstellation upon the back of
Taurus, with what congruity they are described, either in site or
magnitude, in a clear night an ordinary eye may discover, from July unto
April. We will not question the tongues of Adders and Vipers, described
like an Anchor; nor the Picture of the Flower <i>de Luce</i>: though how far
they agree unto their natural draughts, let every spectator determine.</p>

<p>Whether the Cherubims about the Ark be rightly described in the common
Picture, that is, only in humane heads, with two wings; or rather in the
shape of Angels or young men, or somewhat at least with feet, as the
Scripture seems to imply. <span class="sidenote15">2 Chron. 3. 13.</span> Whether the Cross seen
in the air by <i>Constantine</i>, were of that figure wherein we represent
it; or rather made out of Œß and Œ°, the two first letters of œáœÅŒπœÉœÑœåœÇ.
Whether the Cross of Christ did answer the common figure; whether so far
advanced above his head; whether the feet were so disposed, that is, one
upon another, or separately nailed, as some with reason describe it: we
shall not at all contend. Much less whether the house of <i>Diogenes</i> were
a Tub framed of wood, and after the manner of ours, or rather made of
earth, as learned men conceive, and so more clearly make out that
expression of <i>Juvenal</i>.<span class="sidenote">&mdash;&mdash;Dolia <a name="CORR6" id="CORR6"><ins class="correction" title="original: magna">nudi</ins></a> non ardent Cynici, etc.</span> We
should be too critical to question the letter Y, or bicornous element of
<i>Pythagoras</i>, that is, the making of the horns equal: or the left less
then the right, and so destroying the Symbolical intent of the figure;
confounding the narrow line of Vertue, with the larger road of Vice;
answerable unto the narrow door of Heaven, and the ample gates of Hell,
expressed by our Saviour, and not forgotten by <i>Homer</i>, in that Epithete
of <i>Pluto&rsquo;s</i> house.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span><span class="sidenote15">Œï·ΩêœÅœÖœÄœÖŒªŒÆœÇ.</span></p>

<p>Many more there are whereof our pen shall take no notice, nor shall we
urge their enquiry; we shall not enlarge with what incongruity, and how
dissenting from the pieces of Antiquity, the Pictures of their gods and
goddesses are described, and how hereby their symbolical sense is lost;
although herein it were not hard to be informed from <i>Phornutus</i>,
<span class="sidenote">Phornut. De natura deorum.</span> <i>Fulgentius</i>,<span class="sidenote">Fulg. mytho. Logia</span> and
<i>Albricus</i><span class="sidenote"> Albric. De deorum imaginibus.</span> Whether <i>Hercules</i> be
more properly described strangling than tearing the Lion, as <i>Victorius</i>
hath disputed; nor how the characters and figures of the Signs and
Planets be now perverted, as <i>Salmasius</i> hath learnedly declared. We
will dispence with Bears with long tails, such as are described in the
figures of heaven; We shall tolerate flying Horses, black Swans,
Hydra&rsquo;s, Centaur&rsquo;s, Harpies and Satyrs; for these are monstrosities,
rarities, or else Poetical fancies, whose shadowed moralities requite
their substantial falsities. Wherein indeed we must not deny a liberty;
nor is the hand of the Painter more restrainable than the Poet. But
where the real works of Nature, or veritable acts of storie are to be
described, digressions are aberrations; and Art being but the imitator
or secondary representor, it must not vary from the verity of the
example; or describe things otherwise than they truly are or have been.
For hereby introducing false Idea&rsquo;s of things it perverts and deforms
the face and symmetry of truth.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX_PE_V" id="CHAPTER_XX_PE_V">CHAPTER XX</a>
<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of the Hieroglyphical Pictures of the
<i>Egyptians</i>.</span></h2>


<p>Certainly of all men that suffered from the confusion of <i>Babel</i>, the
<i>√Ügyptians</i> found the best evasion; for, though words were confounded,
they invented a language of things, and spake unto each other by common
notions in Nature. Whereby they discoursed in silence, and were
intuitively understood from the theory of their Expresses. For they
assumed the shapes of animals common unto all eyes; and by their
conjunctions and compositions were able to communicate their
conceptions, unto any that co-apprehended the Syntaxis of their Natures.
This many conceive to have been the primitive way of writing, and of
greater antiquity than letters; and this indeed might <i>Adam</i> well have
spoken, who understanding the nature of things, had the advantage of
natural expressions. Which the <i>Egyptians</i> but taking upon trust, upon
their own or common opinion; from conceded mistakes they authentically
promoted errors; describing in their Hieroglyphicks creatures of their
own invention; or from known and conceded animals, erecting
significations not inferrible from their natures.</p>

<p>And first, Although there were more things in Nature than words which
did express them; yet even in these mute and silent discourses, to
express complexed significations, they took a liberty to compound and
piece together creatures of allowable forms into mixtures inexistent.
Thus began the descriptions of Griphins, Basilicks, Ph≈ìnix, and many
more; which <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>Emblematists and Heralds have entertained with
significations answering their institutions; Hieroglyphically adding
Martegres, Wivernes, Lion fishes, with divers others. Pieces of good and
allowable invention unto the prudent Spectator, but are lookt on by
vulgar eyes as literal truths, or absurd impossibilities; whereas
indeed, they are commendable inventions, and of laudable significations.</p>

<p>Again, Beside these pieces fictitiously set down, and having no Copy in
Nature; they had many unquestionable drawn, of inconsequent
signification, nor naturally verifying their intention. We shall
instance but in few, as they stand recorded by <i>Orus</i>. The male sex they
expressed by a Vulture, because of Vultures all are females, and
impregnated by the wind; which authentically transmitted hath passed
many pens, and became the assertion of <i>√Ülian</i>, <i>Ambrose</i>, <i>Basil</i>,
<i>Isidore</i>, <i>Tzetzes</i>, <i>Philes</i>, and others. Wherein notwithstanding what
injury is offered unto the Creation in this confinement of sex, and what
disturbance unto Philosophy in the concession of windy conceptions, we
shall not here declare. By two dragms they thought it sufficient to
signifie an heart; because the heart at one year weigheth two dragms,
that is, a quarter of an ounce, and unto fifty years annually encreaseth
the weight of one dragm, after which in the same proportion it yearly
decreaseth; so that the life of a man doth not naturally extend above an
hundred. And this was not only a popular conceit, but consentaneous unto
their Physical principles, as <i>Heurnius</i> hath accounted it. <span class="sidenote"><i>In
his</i> Philosophia Barbarica.</span></p>

<p>A Woman that hath but one Child, they express by a Lioness; for that
conceiveth but once. Fecundity they set forth by a Goat, because but
seven daies old, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>it beginneth to use coition. The abortion of a Woman
they describe by an Horse kicking a Wolf; because a Mare will cast her
foal if she tread in the track of that animal. Deformity they signifie
by a Bear; and an unstable Man by an Hy√¶na, because that animal yearly
exchangeth its sex. A Woman delivered of a female Child, they imply by a
Bull looking over his left shoulder; because if in coition a Bull part
from a Cow on that side, the Calf will prove a female.</p>

<p>All which, with many more, how far they consent with truth, we shall not
disparage our Reader to dispute; and though some way allowable unto
wiser conceits, who could distinctly receive their significations: yet
carrying the majesty of Hieroglyphicks, and so transmitted by Authors:
they crept into a belief with many, and favourable doubt with most. And
thus, I fear, it hath fared with the Hieroglyphical Symboles of
Scripture: which excellently intended in the species of things
sacrificed, in the prohibited meats, in the dreams of <i>Pharoah</i>,
<i>Joseph</i>, and many other passages: are oft-times wrackt beyond their
symbolizations, and inlarg&rsquo;d into constructions disparaging their true
intentions.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI_PE_V" id="CHAPTER_XXI_PE_V">CHAPTER XXI</a>
<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of the Picture of <i>Haman</i> hanged.</span></h2>


<p>In common draughts, <i>Haman</i> is hanged by the Neck upon an high Gibbet,
after the usual and now practised way of suspension, but whether this
description truly answereth the Original, Learned pens consent not, and
good grounds there are to doubt. For it is not easily made out that this
was an ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span> way of Execution, in the publick punishment of
Malefactors among the <i>Persians</i>; but we often read of Crucifixion in
their Stories. So we find that <i>Oroetes</i><a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> a <i>Persian</i> Governour
crucified <i>Polycrates</i> the <i>Samian</i> Tyrant. And hereof we have an
example in the life of <i>Artaxerxes</i> King of <i>Persia</i>; (whom some will
have to be <i>Ahasuerus</i> in this Story) that his Mother <i>Parysatis</i> flead
and crucified her <i>Eunuch</i>. The same also seems implied in the letters
patent of King <i>Cyrus</i>. <span class="sidenote10"><i>In</i> Ezra 6.</span> <i>Omnis qui hanc mutaverit
jussionem, tollatur lignum de domo ejus, et erigatur et configatur in
eo.</i></p>

<p>The same kind of punishment was in use among the <i>Romans</i>, <i>Syrians</i>,
<i>Egyptians</i>, <i>Carthaginians</i> and <i>Grecians</i>. For though we find in
<i>Homer</i>, that <i>Ulysses</i> in a fury hanged the strumpets of those who
courted <i>Penelope</i>, yet is it not so easie to discover, that this was
the publick practice or open course of justice among the <i>Greeks</i>.</p>

<p>And even that the <i>Hebrews</i> used this present way of hanging, by
illaqueation or pendulous suffocation in publick justice and executions;
the expressions and examples in scripture conclude not beyond good
doubt.</p>

<p>That the King of <i>Hai</i> was hanged, or destroyed by the common way of
suspension, is not conceded by the learned <i>Masius</i> in his comment upon
that text; who conceiveth thereby rather some kind of crucifixion; at
least some patibulary affixion after he was slain; and so represented
unto the people untill toward the evening.</p>

<p>Though we read in our translation, that <i>Pharaoh</i> hanged the chief
Baker, yet learned expositors understand hereby some kind of
crucifixion, according to the mode of <i>Egypt</i>, whereby he exemplarily
hanged <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>out till the fowls of the air fed on his head or face, the first
part of their prey being the eyes. And perhaps according to the signal
draught hereof in a very old manuscript of <i>Genesis</i>, now kept in the
Emperors Library at <i>Vienna</i>; and accordingly set down by the learned
<i>Petrus Zamberius</i>, in the second Tome of the description of that
Library.</p>

<p>When the <i>Gibeonites</i> hanged the bodies of those of the house of <i>Saul</i>,
thereby was intended some kind of crucifying, according unto good
expositors, and the vulgar translation: <i>crucifixerunt eos in monte
coram domino</i>; many both in Scripture and humane writers might be said
to be crucified, though they did not perish immediately by crucifixion:
But however otherwise destroyed, their bodies might be afterward
appended or fastned unto some elevated engine, as exemplary objects unto
the eyes of the people: So sometimes we read of the crucifixion of only
some part, as of the Heads of <i>Julianus</i> and <i>Albinus</i>, though their
bodies were cast away.</p>

<p>That legal Text<span class="sidenote10">Deut. 21.</span> which seems to countenance the common way
of hanging, if a man hath committed a sin worthy of Death, and they hang
him on a Tree; is not so received by Christian and Jewish expositors.
And as a good Annotator of ours<span class="sidenote15">Ainsworth.</span> delivereth, out of
<i>Maimonides</i>: The <i>Hebrews</i> understand not this of putting him to death
by hanging, but of hanging of a Man after he was stoned to death; and
the manner is thus described. After he is stoned to death, they fasten a
piece of timber in the Earth, and out of it there commeth a piece of
wood, and then they tye both his hands one to another, and hang him unto
the setting of the Sun.</p>

<p>Beside, the original word <i>Hakany</i> determineth not the doubt. For that
by <i>Lexicographers</i> or <i>Dictionarie</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span> interpreters, is rendred
suspension and crucifixion; there being no <i>Hebrew</i> word peculiarly and
fully expressing the proper word of crucifixion, as it was used by the
<i>Romans</i>; nor easie to prove it the custom of the <i>Jewish</i> Nation to
nail them by distinct parts unto a Cross, after the manner of our
<span class="smcap">Saviour</span> crucified: wherein it was a special favour indulged unto
<i>Joseph</i> to take down the Body.</p>

<p><i>Lipsius</i><a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> lets fall a good caution to take off doubts about
suspension delivered by ancient Authors, and also the ambiguous sence of
Œ∫œÅŒµŒºŒ¨œÉŒ±Œπ among the <i>Greeks</i>. <i>Tale apud Latinos ipsum suspendere, quod
in crucem referendum moneo juventutem</i>, as that also may be understood
of <i>Seneca</i>. <i>Latrocinium fecit aliquis, quid ergo meruit? ut
suspendatur.</i> And this way of crucifying he conceiveth to have been in
general use among the <i>Romans</i>, until the latter daies of <i>Constantine</i>,
who in reverence unto our <span class="smcap">Saviour</span> abrogated that opprobrious and
infamous way of crucifixion. Whereupon succeeded the common and now
practised way of suspension.</p>

<p>But long before this abrogation of the Cross, the <i>Jewish</i> Nation had
known the true sense of crucifixion; whereof no Nation had a sharper
apprehension, while <i>Adrian</i> crucified five hundred of them every day,
until Wood was wanting for that service. So that they which had nothing
but <i>crucifie</i> in their mouths, were therewith paid home in their own
bodies: Early suffering the reward of their imprecations, and properly
in the same kind.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII_PE_V" id="CHAPTER_XXII_PE_V">CHAPTER XXII</a>
<br /><span class="subtitle90">Compendiously of many questionable Customs,
Opinions, Pictures, Practices, and Popular
Observations.</span></h2>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The ground of many vain observations.</i></div>

<p>1. If an Hare cross the high way, there are few above threescore years
that are not perplexed thereat: which notwithstanding is but an Augurial
terror, according to that received expression, <i>Inauspicatum dat iter
oblatus Lepus.</i> And the ground of the conceit was probably no greater
than this, that a fearful animal passing by us, portended unto us some
thing to be feared: as upon the like consideration, the meeting of a Fox
presaged some future imposture; which was a superstitious observation
prohibited unto the <i>Jews</i>, as is expressed in the Idolatry of
<i>Maimonides</i>, and is referred unto the sin of an observer of Fortunes,
or one that abuseth events unto good or bad signs; forbidden by the Law
of <i>Moses</i><span class="sidenote10">Deut. 18.</span>; which notwithstanding sometimes succeeding,
according to fears or desires, have left impressions and timerous
expectations in credulous minds for ever.</p>

<div class="sidenote15"><i>The Emblem of superstition.</i></div>

<p>2. That Owls and Ravens are ominous appearers, and pre-signifying
unlucky events, as Christians yet conceit, was also an Augurial
conception. Because many Ravens were seen when <i>Alexander</i> entred
<i>Babylon</i>, they were thought to pre-ominate his death; and because an
Owl appeared before the battle, it presaged the ruin of <i>Crassus</i>. Which
though decrepite superstitions, and such as had their nativity in times
beyond all history, are fresh in the observation of many heads, and by
the credulous and feminine party<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span> still in some Majesty among us. And
therefore the Emblem of Superstition was well set out by <i>Ripa</i>
<span class="sidenote">Iconologia de C√¶sare Ripa.</span>, in the picture of an Owl, an Hare, and an
Old Woman. And it no way confirmeth the Augurial consideration, that an
Owl is a forbidden food in the Law of <i>Moses</i>; or that <i>Jerusalem</i> was
threatned by the Raven and the Owl, in that expression of <i>Esay</i> 34.
That it should be a court for Owls, that the Cormorant and the Bittern
should possess it, and the Owl and the Raven dwell in it. For thereby
was only implied their ensuing desolation, as is expounded in the words
succeeding; He shall draw upon it the line of confusion, and the stones
of emptiness.</p>

<p>3. The falling of Salt is an authentick presagement of ill luck, nor can
every temper contemn it; from whence notwithstanding nothing can be
naturally feared: nor was the same a general prognostick of future evil
among the Ancients, but a particular omination concerning the breach of
friendship. For Salt as incorruptible, was the Symbole of friendship,
and before the other service was offered unto their guests; which if it
casually fell, was accounted ominous, and their amity of no duration.
But whether Salt were not only a Symbole of friendship with man, but
also a figure of amity and reconciliation with God, and was therefore
observed in sacrifices, is an higher speculation.</p>

<p>4. To break the egg shell after the meat is out, we are taught in our
childhood, and practise it all our lives; which nevertheless is but a
superstitious relict, according to the judgment of <i>Pliny</i>, <i>Huc
pertinet ovorum, ut exorbuerit quisq; calices protinus frangi, aut
eosdem coclearibus perforari</i>; and the intent hereof was to prevent
witchcraft; for lest witches should draw or prick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span> their names therein,
and veneficiously mischief their persons, they broke the shell, as
<i>Dalecampius</i> hath observed.</p>

<p>5. The true Lovers knot is very much magnified, and still retained in
presents of Love among us; which though in all points it doth not make
out, had perhaps its original from the <i>Nodus Herculanus</i>, or that which
was called <i>Hercules</i> his knot, resembling the snaky complication in the
caduceus or rod of <i>Hermes</i>; and in which form the Zone or woollen
girdle of the Bride was fastned, as <i>Turnebus</i> observeth in his
<i>Adversaria</i>.</p>

<p>6. When our cheek burneth or ear tingleth, we usually say that some body
is talking of us, which is an ancient conceit, and ranked among
superstitious opinions by <i>Pliny</i>. <i>Absentes tinnitu aurium pr√¶sentire
sermones de se receptum est</i>, according to that distick noted by
<i>Dalecampius</i>.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="line"><i>Garrula quid totis resonas mihi noctibus auris?</i></div>
<div class="line"><i>Nescio quem dicis nunc meminisse mei.</i></div>
</div></div>

<p>Which is a conceit hardly to be made out without the concession of a
signifying <i>Genius</i>, or universal <i>Mercury</i>; conducting sounds unto
their distant subjects, and teaching us to hear by touch.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The original of the proverb</i>, Under the Rose be it, <i>etc.</i></div>

<p>7. When we desire to confine our words, we commonly say they are spoken
under the Rose; which expression is commendable, if the Rose from any
natural property may be the Symbole of silence, as <i>Nazianzene</i> seems to
imply in these translated verses:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="line"><i>Utq; latet Rosa Verna suo putamine clausa,</i></div>
<div class="line"><i>Sic os vincla ferat, validisq; arctetur habenis,</i></div>
<div class="line"><i>Indicatq; suis prolixa silentia labris:</i></div>
</div></div>

<p>And is also tolerable, if by desiring a secrecy to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span> words spoke under
the Rose, we only mean in society and compotation, from the ancient
custom in Symposiack meetings, to wear chaplets of Roses about their
heads: and so we condemn not the <i>German</i> custom, which over the Table
describeth a Rose in the cieling. But more considerable it is, if the
original were such as <i>Lemnius</i>, and others have recorded; that the Rose
was the flower of <i>Venus</i>, which <i>Cupid</i> consecrated unto <i>Harpocrates</i>
the God of silence, and was therefore an Emblem thereof, to conceal the
pranks of Venery; as is declared in this Tetrastick;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="line"><i>Est Rosa flos veneris, cujus quo facta laterent,</i></div>
<div class="line indent2"><i>Harpocrati matris, dona dicavit Amor;</i></div>
<div class="line"><i>Inde Rosam mensis hospes suspendit Amicis.</i></div>
<div class="line indent2"><i>Conviv√¶ ut sub e√¢ dicta tacenda sciant.</i></div>
</div></div>

<p>8. That smoak doth follow the fairest, is an usual saying with us, and
in many parts of <i>Europe</i>; whereof although there seem no natural
ground, yet it is the continuation of a very ancient opinion, as <i>Petrus
Victorius</i> and <i>Causabon</i> have observed from a passage in <i>Athen√¶us</i>:
wherein a <i>Parasite</i> thus describeth himself:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="line"><i>To every Table first I come,</i></div>
<div class="line"><i>Whence Porridge I am cal&rsquo;d by some:</i></div>
<div class="line"><i>A Capaneus at Stares I am,</i></div>
<div class="line"><i>To enter any Room a Ram;</i></div>
<div class="line"><i>Like whips and thongs to all I ply,</i></div>
<div class="line"><i>Like smoake unto the Fair I fly.</i></div>
</div></div>

<p>9. To sit cross leg&rsquo;d, or with our fingers pectinated or shut together,
is accounted bad, and friends will perswade us from it. The same conceit
religiously possessed the Ancients, as is observable from <i>Pliny</i>.
<i>Poplites alternis genibus imponere nefas olim</i>; and also from
<i>Athen√¶us</i>, that it was an old veneficious practice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span> and <i>Juno</i> is made
in this posture to hinder the delivery of <i>Alcmena</i>. And therefore, as
<i>Pierius</i> observeth, in the Medal of <i>Julia Pia</i>, the right hand of
<i>Venus</i> was made extended with the inscription of <i>Venus, Genetrix</i>; for
the complication or pectination of the fingers was an Hieroglyphick of
impediment, as in that place he declareth.</p>

<p>10. The set and statary times of pairing of nails, and cutting of hair,
is thought by many a point of consideration; which is perhaps but the
continuation of an ancient superstition. For piaculous it was unto the
<i>Romans</i> to pare their nails upon the Nundin√¶, observed every ninth day;
and was also feared by others in certain daies of the week; according to
that of <i>Ausonius</i>, <i>Ungues Mercurio</i>, <i>Barbam Jove</i>, <i>Cypride Crines</i>;
and was one part of the wickedness that filled up the measure of<span class="sidenote15">2 Chron.33.</span>
<i>Manasses</i>, when &rsquo;tis delivered that he observed times.</p>

<p>11. A common fashion it is to nourish hair upon the mouls of the face;
which is the perpetuation of a very ancient custom; and though
innocently practised among us, may have a superstitious original,
according to that of <i>Pliny</i>, <i>N√¶vos in facie tondere religiosum habent
nunc multi.</i> From the like might proceed the fears of poling Elvelocks
or complicated hairs of the head, and also of locks longer than the
other hair; they being votary at first, and dedicated upon occasion;
preserved with great care, and accordingly esteemed by others, as
appears by that of <i>Apuleius, Adjuro per dulcem capilli tui nodulum.</i></p>

<p>12. A custom there is in most parts of <i>Europe</i> to adorn Aqueducts,
spouts and Cisterns with Lions heads: which though no illaudable
ornament, is of an <i>Egyptian</i> genealogy,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> who practised the same under
a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>symbolical illation. For because the Sun being in Leo, the flood of
<i>Nilus</i> was at the full, and water became conveyed into every part, they
made the spouts of their Aqueducts through the head of a Lion. And upon
some c≈ìlestial respects it is not improbable the great Mogul or
<i>Indian</i> King doth bear for his Arms a Lion and the Sun.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Symbolical significations of the girdle.</i></div>

<p>13. Many conceive there is somewhat amiss, and that as we usually say,
they are unblest until they put on their girdle. Wherein (although most
know not what they say) there are involved unknown considerations. For
by a girdle or cincture are symbolically implied Truth, Resolution, and
Readiness unto action, which are parts and vertues required in the
service of God. According whereto we find that the <i>Israelites</i> did eat
the Paschal Lamb with their loins girded; and the Almighty challenging
<i>Job</i>, bids him gird up his loins like a man. So runneth the expression
of <i>Peter</i>, Gird up the loins of your minds, be sober and hope to the
end: so the high Priest was girt with the girdle of fine linnen: so is
it part of the holy habit to have our lines girt about with truth; <span class="sidenote10">Isa.
11.</span> and so is it also said concerning our Saviour, Righteousness shall be the
girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins. </p>

<p>Moreover by the girdle, the heart and parts which God requires are
divided from the inferior and concupiscential organs; implying thereby a
memento unto purification and cleanness of heart, which is commonly
denied from the concupiscence and affection of those parts; and
therefore unto this day the <i>Jews</i> do bless themselves when they put on
their zone or cincture. And thus may we make out the doctrin of
<i>Pythagoras</i>, to offer sacrifice with our feet naked, that is, that our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
inferiour parts and farthest removed from reason might be free, and of
no impediment unto us. Thus <i>Achilles</i>, though dipped in Styx, yet
having his heel untouched by that water; although he were fortified
elsewhere, he was slain in that part, as only vulnerable in the
inferiour and brutal part of Man. This is that part of <i>Eve</i> and her
posterity the devil still doth bruise, that is, that part of the soul
which adhereth unto earth, and walks in the paths thereof. And in this
secundary and symbolical sense it may be also understood, when the
Priests in the Law washed their feet before the sacrifice; when our
Saviour washed the feet of his Disciples, and said unto <i>Peter</i>, If I
wash not thy feet thou hast no part in me. And thus is it symbolically
explainable, and implyeth purification and cleanness, when in the burnt
offerings the Priest is commanded to wash the inwards and legs thereof
in water; and in the peace and sin-offerings, to burn the two kidneys,
the fat which is about the flanks, and as we translate it, the Caul
above the Liver. But whether the <i>Jews</i> when they blessed themselves,
had any eye unto the words of <i>Jeremy</i>,<span class="sidenote10">Jer. 13.</span> wherein God makes
them his Girdle; or had therein any reference unto the Girdle, which the
Prophet was commanded to hide in the hole of the rock of <i>Euphrates</i>,
and which was the type of their captivity, we leave unto higher
conjecture.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Certain</i> Hereticks <i>who ascribed humane figure unto God,
after which they conceived he created man in his likeness.</i></div>

<p>14. The Picture of the Creator, or God the Father in the shape of an old
Man, is a dangerous piece, and in this Fecundity of sects may revive the
Anthropomorphites. Which although maintained from the expression of
<i>Daniel</i>, I beheld where the Ancient of dayes did sit, whose hair of his
head was like the pure wool; yet may it be also derivative from the
Hieroglyphical description of the <i>√Ügyptians</i>; who to express their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
Eneph, or Creator of the world, described an old man in a blew mantle,
with an egg in his mouth; which was the Emblem of the world. Surely
those heathens, that notwithstanding the exemplary advantage in heaven,
would endure no pictures of Sun or Moon, as being visible unto all the
world, and needing no representation; do evidently accuse the practice
of those pencils, that will describe invisibles. And he that challenged
the boldest hand unto the picture of an Echo, must laugh at this
attempt, not only in the description of invisibility, but
circumscription of Ubiquity, and fetching under lines incomprehensible
circularity.</p>

<p>The Pictures of the <i>√Ügyptians</i> were more tolerable, and in their sacred
letters more veniably expressed the apprehension of Divinity. For though
they implied the same by an eye upon a Scepter, by an √Ügles head, a
Crocodile, and the like: yet did these manual descriptions pretend no
corporal representations; nor could the people misconceive the same unto
real correspondencies. So though the Cherub carried some apprehension of
Divinity, yet was it not conceived to be the shape thereof: and so
perhaps because it is metaphorically predicated of God, that he is a
consuming fire, he may be harmlessly described by a flaming
representation; Yet if, as some will have it, all mediocrity of folly is
foolish, and because an unrequitable evil may ensue, an indifferent
convenience must be omitted; we shall not urge such representments; we
could spare the holy Lamb for the picture of our Saviour, and the Dove
or fiery Tongues to represent the holy Ghost.</p>

<p>15. The Sun and Moon are usually described with humane faces; whether
herein there be not a <i>Pagan</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span> imitation, and those visages at first
implied <i>Apollo</i> and <i>Diana</i>, we may make some doubt; and we find the
statua of the Sun was framed with raies about the head, which were the
indiciduous and unshaven locks of <i>Apollo</i>. We should be too
Iconomical<span class="sidenote"><i>Or quarrelsom with Pictures.</i></span> to question the pictures
of the winds, as commonly drawn in humane heads, and with their cheeks
distended; which notwithstanding we find condemned by <i>Minutius</i>, as
answering poetical fancies, and the gentile description of <i>√Üolus</i>,
<i>Boreas</i>, and the feigned Deities of winds.</p>

<p>16. We shall not, I hope, disparage the Resurrection of our Redeemer, if
we say the Sun doth not dance on Easter day. And though we would
willingly assent unto any sympathetical exultation, yet cannot conceive
therein any more than a Tropical expression. Whether any such motion
there were in that day wherein Christ arised, Scripture hath not
revealed, which hath been punctual in other records concerning solary
miracles: and the Areopagite<span class="sidenote"><i>Dion.</i> Ep. 7. <i>a.</i> ad Policar. et Pet.
Hall not. in vit. <a name="CORR7" id="CORR7"><ins class="correction" title="original: 3. Dionys.">S. Dionys.</ins></a></span> that was amazed at the Eclipse, took no
notice of this. And if metaphorical expressions go so far, we may be
bold to affirm, not only that one Sun danced, but two arose that day:
That light appeared at his nativity, and darkness at his death, and yet
a light at both; for even that darkness was a light unto the <i>Gentiles</i>,
illuminated by that obscurity. That &rsquo;twas the first time the Sun set
above the Horizon; that although there were darkness above the earth,
there was light beneath it, nor dare we say that hell was dark if he
were in it.</p>

<p>17. Great conceits are raised of the involution or membranous covering,
commonly called the Silly-how, that sometimes is found about the heads
of children upon their birth; and is therefore preserved with great
care, not only as medical in diseases, but effectual in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span> success,
concerning the Infant and others; which is surely no more than a
continued superstition. For hereof we read in the life of <i>Antoninus</i>
delivered by <i>Spartianus</i>, that children are born sometimes with this
natural cap; which Midwives were wont to sell unto credulous Lawyers,
who had an opinion it advantaged their promotion.</p>

<p>But to speak strictly, the effect is natural, and thus may be conceived:
Animal conceptions have largely taken three teguments, or membranous
films which cover them in the womb, that is, the Corion, Amnios, and
Allantois; the Corion is the outward membrance wherein are implanted the
Veins, Arteries and umbilical vessels, whereby its nourishment is
conveyed: the Allantois a thin coat seated under the Corion, wherein are
received the watery separations conveyed by the Urachus, that the
acrimony thereof should not offend the skin. <span class="sidenote">De formato
f≈ìtu.</span> The Amnios is a general investment, containing the sudorus or
thin serosity perspirable through the skin. Now about the time when the
Infant breaketh these coverings, it sometimes carrieth with it about the
head a part of the Amnios or nearest coat; which saith <i>Spiegelius</i>,
either proceedeth from the toughness of the membrance or weakness of the
Infant that cannot get clear thereof. And therefore herein
significations are natural and concluding upon the Infant, but not to be
extended unto magical signalities, or any other person.</p>

<p>18. That &rsquo;tis good to be drunk once a moneth, is a common flattery of
sensuality, supporting it self upon Physick, and the healthful effects
of inebriation. This indeed seems plainly affirmed by <i>Avicenna</i>, a
Physitian of great authority, and whose religion prohibiting Wine, could
less extenuate ebriety. But <i>Averroes</i> a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span> man of his own faith was of
another belief; restraining his ebriety unto hilarity, and in effect
making no more thereof than <i>Seneca</i> commendeth, and was allowable in
<i>Cato</i>; that is, a sober incalescence and regulated √¶stuation from wine;
or what may be conceived between <i>Joseph</i> and his brethren, when the
text expresseth they were merry, or drank largely, and whereby indeed
the commodities set down by <i>Avicenna</i>, that is, alleviation of spirits,
resolution of superfluities, provocation of sweat and urine may also
ensue. But as for dementation, sopition of reason, and the diviner
particle from drink; though <i>American</i> religion approve, and <i>Pagan</i>
piety of old hath practised it, even at their sacrifices; Christian
morality and the doctrine of Christ will not allow. And surely that
religion which excuseth the fact of <i>Noah</i>, in the aged surprizal of six
hundred years, and unexpected inebriation from the unknown effects of
wine, will neither acquit ebriosity nor ebriety, in their known and
intended perversions.</p>

<p>And indeed, although sometimes effects succeed which may relieve the
body, yet if they carry mischief or peril unto the soul, we are therein
restrainable by Divinity, which circumscribeth Physick, and
circumstantially determines the use thereof. From natural
considerations, Physick commendeth the use of venery; and happily,
incest, adultery, or stupration may prove as Physically advantagious, as
conjugal copulation; which notwithstanding must not be drawn into
practise. And truly effects, consequents, or events which we commend,
arise oft-times from wayes which we all condemn. Thus from the fact of
<i>Lot</i>, we derive the generation of <i>Ruth</i>, and blessed Nativity of our
Saviour; which notwithstanding did not extenuate the incestuous ebriety
of the generator. And if, as is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span> commonly urged, we think to extenuate
ebriety from the benefit of vomit oft succeeding, <i>Egyptian</i> sobriety
will condemn us, which purged both wayes twice a moneth, without this
perturbation: and we foolishly contemn the liberal hand of God, and
ample field of medicines which sobriety produce that action.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Why the devil is commonly said to appear with a cloven
foot.</i></div>

<p>19. A conceit there is, that the Devil commonly appeareth with a cloven
hoof; wherein although it seem excessively ridiculous, there may be
somewhat of truth; and the ground thereof at first might be his frequent
appearing in the shape of a Goat, which answers that description. This
was the opinion of ancient Christians concerning the apparition of
Panites, Fauns and Satyres; and in this form we read of one that
appeared unto <i>Antony</i> in the wilderness. The same is also continued
from expositions of holy Scripture; for whereas it is said,<span class="sidenote10">Levit.
17.</span> Thou shalt not offer unto Devils, the Original word is
<i>Seghnirim</i>, that is, rough and hairy Goats, because in that shape the
Devil most often appeared; as is expounded by the <i>Rabbins</i>, as
<i>Tremellius</i> hath also explained; and as the word <i>Ascimah</i>, the god of
<i>Emath</i> is by some conceived. Nor did he only assume this shape in elder
times, but commonly in later dayes, especially in the place of his
worship, if there be any truth in the confession of Witches, and as in
many stories it stands confirmed by <i>Bodinus</i>.<span class="sidenote"><i>In his</i>
D√¶monomania.</span> And therefore a Goat is not improperly made the
Hieroglyphick of the devil, as <i>Pierius</i> hath expressed it. So might it
be the Emblem of sin, as it was in the sin-offering; and so likewise of
wicked and sinful men, according to the expression of Scripture in the
method of the last distribution; when our Saviour shall separate the
Sheep from the Goats, that is, the Sons of the Lamb from the children of
the devil.</p>

<p>1. That temperamental dignotions, and conjecture of prevalent humours,
may be collected from spots in our nails, we are not averse to concede.
But yet not ready to admit sundry divinations, vulgarly raised upon
them. Nor do we observe it verified in others, what <i>Cardan</i><span class="sidenote">De
varietate rerum.</span> discovered as a property in himself: to have found
therein some signs of most events that ever happened unto him. Or that
there is much considerable in that doctrine of Cheiromancy, that spots
in the top of the nails do signifie things past; in the middle, things
present; and at the bottom, events to come. That white specks presage
our felicity, blew ones our misfortunes. That those in the nail of the
thumb have significations of honour, those in the forefinger, of riches,
and so respectively in other fingers, (according to Planetical
relations, from whence they receive their names) as <i>Tricassus</i> hath
taken up, <span class="sidenote15">De inspectione manus.</span>and <i>Picciolus</i> well rejecteth.</p>

<p>We shall not proceed to querie, what truth there is in Palmistry, or
divination from those lines in our hands, of high denomination. Although
if any thing be therein, it seems not confinable unto man; but other
creatures are also considerable; as is the fore-foot of the Moll, and
especially of the Monkey; wherein we have observed the table line, that
of life, and of the liver.</p>

<p>2. That Children committed unto the school of Nature, without
institution would naturally speak the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span> primitive language of the world,
was the opinion of ancient heathens, and continued since by Christians:
who will have it our <i>Hebrew</i> tongue, as being the language of <i>Adam</i>.
That this were true, were much to be desired, not only for the easie
attainment of that useful tongue, but to determine the true and
primitive Hebrew. For whether the present Hebrew, be the unconfounded
language of <i>Babel</i>, and that which remaining in <i>Heber</i> was continued
by <i>Abraham</i> and his posterity, or rather the language of <i>Ph≈ìnicia</i>
and <i>Canaan</i>, wherein he lived, some learned men I perceive do yet
remain unsatisfied. Although I confess probability stands fairest for
the former: nor are they without all reason, who think that at the
confusion of tongues, there was no constitution of a new speech in every
family: but a variation and permutation of the old; out of one common
language raising several Dialects: the primitive tongue remaining still
intire. Which they who retained, might make a shift to understand most
of the rest. <span class="sidenote"><i>How</i> Abraham <i>might understand the language of
several Nations.</i></span> By vertue whereof in those primitive times and
greener confusions, <i>Abraham</i> of the family of <i>Heber</i> was able to
converse with the <i>Chaldeans</i>, to understand <i>Mesopotamians</i>,
<i>Cananites</i>, <i>Philistins</i>, and <i>Egyptians</i>: whose several Dialects he
could reduce unto the Original and primitive tongue, and so be able to
understand them.</p>

<p>3. Though useless unto us, and rather of molestation, we commonly
refrain from killing Swallows, and esteem it unlucky to destroy them:
whether herein there be not a <i>Pagan</i> relique, we have some reason to
doubt. For we read in <i>√Ülian</i>, that these birds were sacred unto the
<i>Penates</i> or houshold gods of the ancients, and therefore were
preserved. The same they also honoured as the nuncio&rsquo;s of the spring;
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span> we find in <i>Athen√¶us</i>
<span class="sidenote"><i>The same is extant in the</i> 8th <i>of</i>
Athen√¶us.</span> that the <i>Rhodians</i> had a solemn song to welcome in the
Swallow.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Why candles may burn blew, before the apparition of a
spirit.</i></div>

<p>4. That Candles and Lights burn dim and blew at apparition of spirits,
may be true, if the ambient ayr be full of sulphurious spirits, as it
happeneth oft-times in mines; where damps and acide exhalations are able
to extinguish them. And may be also verified, when spirits do make
themselves visible by bodies of such effluviums. But of lower
consideration is the common foretelling of strangers, from the fungous
parcels about the weeks of Candles: which only signifieth a moist and
pluvious ayr about them, hindering the avolation of the light and
favillous particles: whereupon they are forced to settle upon the Snast.</p>

<p>5. Though Coral doth properly preserve and fasten the Teeth in men, yet
is it used in Children to make an easier passage for them: and for that
intent is worn about their necks. But whether this custom were not
superstitiously founded, as presumed an amulet or defensative against
fascination, is not beyond all doubt. For the same is delivered by
<i>Pliny</i>.<span class="sidenote10">Lib. 32.</span> <i>Aruspices religiosum Coralli gestamen amoliendis
periculis arbitrantur; et surculi infanti√¶ alligati, tutelam habere
creduntur.</i></p>

<p>6. A strange kind of exploration and peculiar way of Rhabdomancy is that
which is used in mineral discoveries; that is, with a forked hazel,
commonly called <i>Moses</i> his Rod, which freely held forth, will stir and
play if any mine be under it. And though many there are who have
attempted to make it good, yet until better information, we are of
opinion with <i>Agricola</i><span class="sidenote">De re metallica, lib. 2.</span>, that in it self
it is a fruitless exploration, strongly scenting of <i>Pagan</i> derivation,
and the <i>virgula Divina</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span> proverbially magnified of old. The ground
whereof were the Magical rods in Poets that of <i>Pallas</i> in <i>Homer</i>, that
of <i>Mercury</i> that charmed <i>Argus</i>, and that of <i>Circe</i> which transformed
the followers of <i>Ulysses</i>. Too boldly usurping the name of <i>Moses</i> rod,
from which notwithstanding, and that of <i>Aaron</i>, were probably
occasioned the fables of all the rest. For that of <i>Moses</i> must needs be
famous unto the <i>√Ügyptians</i>; and that of <i>Aaron</i> unto many other
Nations, as being preserved in the Ark, until the destruction of the
Temple built by <i>Solomon</i>.</p>

<p>7. A practise there is among us to determine doubtful matters, by the
opening of a book, and letting fall a staff; which notwithstanding are
ancient fragments of <i>Pagan</i> divinations. The first an imitation of
<i>Sortes Homeric√¶</i>; or <i>Virgilian√¶</i>, drawing determinations from verses
casually occurring. The same was practised by <i>Severus</i>, who entertained
ominous hopes of the Empire, from that verse in <i>Virgil</i>, <i>Tu regere
imperio populos, Romane, memento</i>; and <i>Cordianus</i> who reigned but few
dayes was discouraged by another, that is, <i>Ostendunt terris hunc tantum
fata, nec ultra esse sinunt.</i> Nor was this only performed in heathen
Authors, but upon the sacred text of Scripture, as <i>Gregorius
Turonensis</i> hath left some account, and as the practise of the Emperour
<i>Heraclius</i>, before his Expedition into <i>Asia</i> minor, is delivered by
<i>Cedrenus</i>.</p>

<p>As for the Divination or decision from the staff; it is an Augurial
relique, and the practise thereof is accused by God himself<span class="sidenote10">Hosea
4.</span>; My people ask counsel of their stocks, and their staff declareth
unto them. Of this kind of Rhabdomancy was that practised by
<i>Nabuchadonozor</i> in that <i>Caldean</i> miscellany, delivered by
<i>Ezekiel</i>;<span class="sidenote10">Ezek. 24.</span> the king of <i>Babylon</i> stood at the parting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span> of
the way, at the head of two wayes to use divination, he made his arrows
bright, he consulted with Images, he looked in the Liver; at the right
hand were the divinations of <i>Jerusalem</i>. That is, as <i>Estius</i> expounded
it, the left way leading unto <i>Rabbah</i>, the chief City of the
<i>Ammonites</i>, and the right unto <i>Jerusalem</i>, he consulted <i>Idols</i> and
entrails, he threw up a bundle of arrows to see which way they would
light; and falling on the right hand he marched towards <i>Jerusalem</i>. A
like way of Belomancy or Divination by arrows hath been in request with
<i>Scythians</i>, <i>Alanes</i>, <i>Germans</i>, with the <i>Africans</i> and <i>Turks</i> of
<i>Algier</i>. But of another nature was that which was practised by
<i>Elisha</i>,<span class="sidenote15">2 King. 13.15.</span> when by an arrow shot from an Eastern
window, he pre-signified the destruction of <i>Syria</i>; or when according
unto the three stroaks of <i>Joash</i>, with an arrow upon the ground, he
foretold the number of his victories. For thereby the spirit of God
particular&rsquo;d the same; and determined the stroaks of the King unto
three, which the hopes of the Prophet expected in twice that number.</p>

<p>8. We cannot omit to observe the tenacity of ancient customs, in the
nominal observation of the several dayes of the week, according to
<i>Gentile</i> and <i>Pagan</i> appellations <span class="sidenote15">Dion. Cassii. lib. 37.</span>: for the
Original is very high, and as old as the ancient <i>√Ügyptians</i>, who named
the same according to the seven Planets, the admired stars of heaven,
and reputed Deities among them. Unto every one assigning a several day;
not according to their c≈ìlestial order, or as they are disposed in
heaven; but after a diatesseron or musical fourth. For beginning
Saturday with Saturn, the supremest Planet, they accounted by Jupiter
and Mars unto Sol, making Sunday. From Sol in like manner by Venus and
Mercury unto Luna,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span> making Munday; and so through all the rest. And the
same order they confirmed by numbering the hours of the day unto twenty
four, according to the natural order of the Planets. For beginning to
account from Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, and so about unto twenty four, the
next day will fall unto Sol; whence accounting twenty four, the next
will happen unto Luna, making Munday. And so with the rest, according to
the account and order observed still among us.</p>

<p>The <i>Jews</i> themselves in their Astrological considerations, concerning
Nativities, and Planetary hours, observe the same order, upon as witty
foundations. Because by an equal interval, they make seven triangles,
the bases whereof are the seven sides of a septilateral figure,
described within a circle. That is, If a figure of seven sides be
described in a circle, and at the angles thereof the names of the
Planets be placed in their natural order on it: if we begin with Saturn,
and successively draw lines from angle to angle, until seven equicrural
triangles be described, whose bases are the seven sides of the
septilateral figure; the triangles will be made by this order. The first
being made by Saturn, Sol and Luna, that is, Saturday, Sunday, and
Munday; and so the rest in the order still retained. <span class="sidenote">Cujus Icon
apud doct. Iaffarel. chap. 11. Et Fabrit. Paduantum.</span></p>

<p>But thus much is observable, that however in c≈ìlestial considerations
they embraced the received order of the Planets, yet did they not retain
either characters, or names in common use amongst us; but declining
humane denominations, they assigned them names from some remarkable
qualities; as is very observable in their red and splendent Planets,
that is, of Mars<span class="sidenote10">Maadim.</span> and Venus.<span class="sidenote10">Nogah.</span> But the change of
their names disparaged not the consideration of their natures; nor did
they thereby reject all memory of these remarkable Stars; which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span> God
himself admitted in his Tabernacle, if conjecture will hold concerning
the Golden Candlestick, whose shaft resembled the Sun, and six branches
the Planets about it.</p>

<p>9. We are unwilling to enlarge concerning many other; only referring
unto sober examination, what natural effects can reasonably be expected,
when to prevent the Ephialtes or night-Mare we hang up an hollow stone
in our stables; when for amulets against Agues we use the chips of
Gallows and places of execution. When for Warts we rub our hands before
the Moon, or commit any maculated part unto the touch of the dead. What
truth there is in those common female Doctrines, that the first Rib of
Roast Beef powdered is a peculiar remedy against Fluxes. That to urine
upon earth newly cast up by a Moll, bringeth down the menses in Women.
That if a Child dieth, and the neck becommeth not stiff, but for many
howers remaineth Lythe and Flaccid, some other in the same house will
dye not long after. That if a woman with child looketh upon a dead body,
her child will be of a pale complexion, our learned Philosophers and
critical Philosophers might illustrate, whose exacter performances our
adventures do but solicite; mean while, I hope, they will plausibly
receive our attempts, or candidly correct our misconjectures.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The age of the world not certainly determinable.</i></div>

<p>Concerning the World and its temporal circumscriptions, who ever shall
strictly examine both extreams, will easily perceive there is not only
obscurity in its end, but its beginning; that as its period is
inscrutable, so is its nativity indeterminable: That as it is
presumption to enquire after the one, so is there no rest or
satisfactory decision in the other. And hereunto we shall more readily
assent, if we examine the informations, and take a view of the several
difficulties in this point; which we shall more easily do, if we
consider the different conceits of men, and duly perpend the
imperfections of their discoveries.</p>

<p>And first, The histories of the <i>Gentiles</i> afford us slender
satisfaction, nor can they relate any story, or affix a probable point
to its beginning. For some thereof (and those of the wisest amongst
them) are so far from determining its beginning, that they opinion and
maintain it never had any at all; as the doctrin of <i>Epicurus</i> implieth,
and more positively <i>Aristotle</i> in his books <i>De C≈ìlo</i> declareth.
Endeavouring to confirm it with arguments of reason, and those
appearingly demonstrative; wherein his labours are rational, and
uncontroulable upon the grounds assumed, that is, of Physical
generation, and a Primary or first matter, beyond which no other hand
was apprehended. But herein we remain sufficiently satisfied from
<i>Moses</i>, and the Doctrin delivered of the Creation; that is, a
production of all things out of nothing, a formation not only of matter,
but of form, and a materiation even of matter it self.</p>

<p>Others are so far from defining the Original of the World or of mankind,
that they have held opinions not only repugnant unto Chronology, but
Philosophy;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span> that is, that they had their beginning in the soil where
they inhabited; assuming or receiving appellations conformable unto such
conceits. <span class="sidenote"><i>Why the</i> Athenians <i>did wear a golden Insect upon their
head.</i></span> So did the <i>Athenians</i>, term themselves Œ±·ΩêœÑŒøœáŒ∏œåŒΩŒµœÇ or
<i>Aborigines</i>, and in testimony thereof did wear a golden Insect on their
heads: the same name is also given unto the Inlanders, or <i>Midland</i>
inhabitants of this Island by <i>C√¶sar</i>. But this is a conceit answerable
unto the generation of the Giants; not admittable in Philosophy, much
less in Divinity, which distinctly informeth we are all the seed of
<i>Adam</i>, that the whole world perished unto eight persons before the
flood, and was after peopled by the <i>Colonies</i> of the sons of <i>Noah</i>.
There was therefore never any <i>Autochthon</i>, or man arising from the
earth but <i>Adam</i>; for the Woman being formed out of the rib, was once
removed from earth, and framed from that Element under incarnation. And
so although her production were not by copulation, yet was it in a
manner seminal: For if in every part from whence the seed doth flow,
there be contained the Idea of the whole; there was a seminality and
contracted <i>Adam</i> in the rib, which by the information of a soul, was
individuated into <i>Eve</i>. And therefore this conceit applied unto the
Original of man, and the beginning of the world, is more justly
appropriable unto its end. For then indeed men shall rise out of the
earth: the graves shall shoot up their concealed seeds, and in that
great Autumn, men shall spring up, and awake from their Chaos again.</p>

<p>Others have been so blind in deducing the Original of things, or
delivering their own beginnings, that when it hath fallen into
controversie, they have not recurred unto Chronologie or the Records of
time: but betaken themselves unto probabilities, and the
con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>jecturalities of Philosophy. Thus when the two ancient Nations,
<i>Egyptians</i> and <i>Scythians</i>, contended for antiquity, the <i>Egyptians</i>
pleaded their antiquity from the fertility of their soil,<span class="sidenote">Diodor.
Justin.</span> inferring that men there first inhabited, where they were with
most facility sustained; and such a land did they conceive was <i>Egypt</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Scythians</i>, although a cold and heavier Nation urged more acutely,
deducing their arguments from the two active Elements and Principles of
all things, Fire and Water. For if of all things there was first an
union, and that Fire over-ruled the rest: surely that part of earth
which was coldest, would first get free, and afford a place of
habitation. But if all the earth were first involved in Water, those
parts would surely first appear, which were most high, and of most
elevated situation, and such was theirs. These reasons carried indeed
the antiquity from the <i>Egyptians</i>, but confirmed it not in the
<i>Scythians</i>: for as <i>Herodotus</i> relateth from <i>Pargitaus</i>, their first
King unto <i>Darius</i>, they accounted but two thousand years.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>That men speak not by natural instinct, but by instruction
and imitation.</i></div>

<p>As for the <i>Egyptians</i> they invented another way of trial; for as the
same Author relateth, <i>Psammitichus</i> their King attempted this decision
by a new and unknown experiment, bringing up two Infants with Goats, and
where they never heard the voice of man; concluding that to be the
ancientest Nation, whose language they should first deliver. But herein
he forgot that speech was by instruction not instinct, by imitation, not
by nature, that men do speak in some kind but like Parrets, and as they
are instructed, that is, in simple terms and words, expressing the open
notions of things; which the second act of Reason compoundeth into
propositions, and the last into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span> Syllogisms and Forms of ratiocination.
And howsoever the account of <i>Manethon</i> the <i>Egyptian</i> Priest run very
high, and it be evident that <i>Mizraim</i> peopled that Country (whose name
with the <i>Hebrews</i> it beareth unto this day) and there be many things of
great antiquity related in Holy Scripture, yet was their exact account
not very ancient; for <i>Ptolomy</i> their Country-man beginning his
Astronomical compute no higher than <i>Nabonasser</i>, who is conceived by
some the same with <i>Salmanasser</i>. As for the argument deduced from the
Fertility of the soil, duly enquired, it rather overthroweth than
promoteth their antiquity; if that Country whose Fertility they so
advance, was in ancient times no firm or open land, but some vast lake
or part of the Sea, and became a gained ground by the mud and limous
matter brought down by the River <i>Nilus</i>, which setled by degrees into a
firm land. According as is expressed by <i>Strabo</i>, and more at large by
<i>Herodotus</i>, both from the <i>Egyptian</i> tradition and probable inducements
from reason, called therefore <i>fluvii donum</i>, an accession of earth, or
tract of land acquired by the River.</p>

<p>Lastly, Some indeed there are, who have kept Records of time, and a
considerable duration, yet do the exactest thereof afford no
satisfaction concerning the beginning of the world, or any way point out
the time of its creation. The most authentick Records and best approved
antiquity are those of the <i>Chaldeans</i>; yet in the time of <i>Alexander</i>
the Great, they attained not so high as the flood. For as <i>Simplicius</i>
relateth, <i>Aristotle</i> required of <i>Calisthenes</i>, who accompanied that
Worthy in his Expedition, that at his arrive at <i>Babylon</i>, he would
enquire of the antiquity of their Records; and those upon compute he
found to amount unto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span> 1903 years; which account notwithstanding ariseth
no higher than 95 years after the flood. The <i>Arcadians</i> I confess, were
esteemed of great antiquity, and it was usually said they were before
the Moon, according unto that of <i>Seneca</i>, <i>Sydus post veteres Arcades
editum</i>; and that of <i>Ovid</i>, <i>Lun√¢ gens prior illa fuit.</i> But this as
<i>Censorinus</i> observeth, must not be taken grosly, as though they were
existent before that Luminary; but were so esteemed, because they
observed a set course of year, before the <i>Greeks</i> conformed their year
unto the course and motion of the Moon.</p>

<p>Thus the Heathens affording no satisfaction herein, they are most likely
to manifest this truth, who have been acquainted with Holy Scripture,
and the sacred Chronology delivered by <i>Moses</i>, who distinctly sets down
this account, computing by certain intervails, by memorable <i>√Üras</i>,
<i>Epoches</i>, or terms of time. As from the Creation unto the flood, from
thence unto <i>Abraham</i>, from <i>Abraham</i> unto the departure from <i>Egypt</i>,
etc. Now in this number have only been <i>Samaritans</i>, <i>Jews</i> and
<i>Christians</i>. <span class="sidenote"><i>Different accounts upon Scripture concerning the Age
of the World.</i></span> For the <i>Jews</i> they agree not in their accounts, as
<i>Bodine</i> in his method of History hath observed out of <i>Baal Seder</i>,
<i>Rabbi Nassom</i>, <i>Gersom</i>, and others; in whose compute the age of the
World is not yet 5400 years. The same is more evidently observable from
the two most learned <i>Jews</i>, <i>Philo</i> and <i>Josephus</i>; who very much
differ in the accounts of time, and variously sum up these Intervails
assented unto by all. Thus <i>Philo</i> from the departure out of <i>Egypt</i>
unto the building of the Temple, accounts but 920 years, but <i>Josephus</i>
sets down 1062. <i>Philo</i> from the building of the Temple to its
destruction 440. <i>Josephus</i> 470. <i>Philo</i> from the Creation to the
Destruction of the Temple 3373, but <i>Josephus</i> 3513. <i>Philo</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span> from the
Deluge to the Destruction of the Temple 1718, but <i>Josephus</i> 1913. In
which Computes there are manifest disparities, and such as much divide
the concordance and harmony of times.</p>

<p>For the <i>Samaritans</i>; their account is different from these or any
others; for they account from the Creation to the Deluge, but 1302
years; which cometh to pass upon the different account of the ages of
the Patriarks set down when they begat children. For whereas the
<i>Hebrew</i>, <i>Greek</i> and <i>Latin</i> texts account <i>Jared</i> 162 when he begat
<i>Enoch</i>, they account but 62, and so in others. Now the <i>Samaritans</i>
were no incompetent Judges of times and the Chronology thereof; for they
embraced the five books of <i>Moses</i>, and as it seemeth, preserved the
Text with far more integrity then the <i>Jews</i>; who as <i>Tertullian</i>,
<i>Chrysostom</i>, and others observe, did several wayes corrupt the same,
especially in passages concerning the prophesies of Christ; So that as
<i>Jerom</i> professeth, in his translation he was fain sometime to relieve
himself by the <i>Samaritan</i> Pentateuch; as amongst others in that Text,
<i>Deuteronomy</i> 27. <i>Maledictus omnis qui non permanserit in omnibus qu√¶
scripta sunt in libro Legis.</i> From hence Saint <i>Paul</i> <span class="sidenote10">Gal. 3.</span>
inferreth there is no justification by the Law, and urgeth the Text
according to the Septuagint. Now the Jews to afford a latitude unto
themselves, in their copies expunged the word ◊ë◊ú or Syncategorematical
term <i>omnis</i>: wherein lieth the strength of the Law, and of the Apostles
argument; but the <i>Samaritan</i> Bible retained it right, and answerable
unto what the Apostle had urged.</p>

<p>As for Christians from whom we should expect the exactest and most
concurring account, there is also in them a manifest disagreement, and
such as is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span> easily reconciled. For first, the Latins accord not in
their account: to omit the calculation of the Ancients, of <i>Austin</i>,
<i>Bede</i>, and others, the Chronology of the Moderns doth manifestly
dissent. <i>Josephus Scaliger</i>, whom <i>Helvicus</i> seems to follow, accounts
the Creation in 765 of the <i>Julian</i> period; and from thence unto the
Nativity of our Saviour alloweth 3947 years; but <i>Dionysius Petavius</i> a
learned Chronologer dissenteth from this compute almost 40 years;
placing the Creation in <a name="CORR8" id="CORR8"><ins class="correction" title="sic">the</ins></a> 730 of the <i>Julian</i> period, and from thence
unto the Incarnation accounteth 3983 years.</p>

<p>For the Greeks; their accounts are more anomalous: for if we recur unto
ancient computes, we shall find that <i>Clemens Alexandrinus</i>, an ancient
Father and <i>Pr√¶ceptor</i> unto <i>Origen</i>, accounted from the Creation unto
our Saviour, 5664 years; for in the first of his Stromaticks, he
collecteth the time from <i>Adam</i> unto the death of <i>Commodus</i> to be 5858
years; now the death of <i>Commodus</i> he placeth in the year after Christ
194, which number deducted from the former, there remaineth 5664.
<i>Theophilus</i> Bishop of <i>Antioch</i> accounteth unto the Nativity of Christ
5515, deduceable from the like way of compute, for in his first book <i>ad
Autolychum</i>, he accounteth from <i>Adam</i> unto <i>Aurelius Verus</i> 5695 years;
now that Emperour died in the year of our Lord 180, which deducted from
the former sum, there remaineth 5515. <i>Julius Africanus</i>, an ancient
Chronologer, accounteth somewhat less, that is, 5500. <i>Eusebius</i>,
<i>Orosius</i> and others dissent not much from this, but all exceed five
thousand.</p>

<p>The latter compute of the Greeks, as <i>Petavius</i> observeth, hath been
reduced unto two or three accounts. The first accounts unto our Saviour
5501, and this hath been observed by <i>Nicephorus</i>, <i>Theo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>phanes</i>, and
<i>Maximus</i>. <span class="sidenote"><i>By what account the world hath lasted 7154 years.</i></span> The
other accounts 5509; and this of all at present is generally received by
the Church of <i>Constantinople</i>, observed also by the <i>Moscovite</i>, as I
have seen in the date of the Emperors letters; wherein this year of ours
1645 is from the year of the world 7154, which doth exactly agree unto
this last account 5509, for if unto that sum be added 1645, the product
will be 7154, by this Chronology are many Greek Authors to be
understood; and thus is <i>Martinus Crusius</i> to be made out, when in his
Turcogrecian history he delivers, the City of <i>Constantinople</i> was taken
by the Turks in the year œõœ†ŒæŒ±; that is, 6961. Now according unto these
Chronologists, the Prophecy of <i>Elias</i> the Rabbin, so much in request
with the Jews, and in some credit also with Christians, that the world
should last but six thousand years; unto these I say, it hath been long
and out of memory disproved, for the Sabbatical and 7000 year wherein
the world should end (as did the Creation on the seventh day) unto them
is long ago expired; they are proceeding in the eight thousand year, and
numbers exceeding those days which men have made the types and shadows
of these. But certainly what <i>Marcus Leo</i> the Jew conceiveth of the end
of the heavens, exceedeth the account of all that ever shall be; for
though he conceiveth the Elemental frame shall end in the Seventh or
Sabbatical Millenary, yet cannot he opinion the heavens and more durable
part of the Creation shall perish before seven times seven, or 49, that
is, the Quadrant of the other seven, and perfect Jubilee of thousands.</p>

<p>Thus may we observe the difference and wide dissent of mens opinions,
and thereby the great incertainty in this establishment. The Hebrews not
only dissenting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span> from the Samaritans, the Latins from the Greeks, but
every one from another. Insomuch that all can be in the right it is
impossible; that any one is so, not with assurance determinable. And
therefore as <i>Petavius</i> confesseth, to effect the same exactly without
inspiration it is impossible, and beyond the Arithmetick of any but God
himself. And therefore also what satisfaction may be obtained from those
violent disputes, and eager enquirers in what day of the month the world
began either of March or October; likewise in what face or position of
the Moon, whether at the prime or full, or soon after, let our second
and serious considerations determine.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The cause of so different accounts about the age of the
world.</i></div>

<p>Now the reason and ground of this dissent, is the unhappy difference
between the Greek and Hebrew Editions of the Bible, for unto these two
Languages have all translations conformed; the holy Scripture being
first delivered in Hebrew, and first translated into Greek. For the
Hebrew; it seems the primitive and surest text to rely on, and to
preserve the same entire and uncorrupt there hath been used the highest
caution humanity could invent. For as <i>R. Ben. Maimon</i> hath declared, if
in the copying thereof one letter were written twice, or if one letter
but touched another, that copy was not admitted into their Synagogues,
but only allowable to be read in Schools and private families. Neither
were they careful only in the exact number of their Sections of the Law,
but had also the curiosity to number every word, and affixed the account
unto their several books. <span class="sidenote"><i>Corruption even in the Hebrew Text of
the Bible.</i></span> Notwithstanding all which, divers corruptions ensued, and
several depravations slipt in, arising from many and manifest grounds,
as hath been exactly noted by <i>Morinus</i> in his preface unto the
Septuagint.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>As for the Septuagint, it is the first and most ancient Translation; and
of greater antiquity than the Chaldee version; occasioned by the request
of <i>Ptolomeus Philadelphus</i>, King of <i>Egypt</i>, for the ornament of his
memorable Library; unto whom the high Priest addressed six Jews out of
every Tribe, which amounteth unto 72; and by these was effected that
Translation we usually term the Septuagint, or Translation of seventy.
<span class="sidenote"><i>The Credit of the Septuagint translation.</i></span> Which name, however it
obtain from the number of their persons, yet in respect of one common
Spirit, it was the Translation but as it were of one man; if as the
story relateth, although they were set apart and severed from each
other, yet were their Translations found to agree in every point,
according as is related by <i>Philo</i> and <i>Josephus</i>; although we find not
the same in <i>Arist√¶as,</i> <span class="sidenote">Aristeas ad Philocratorem de 72
interpretibus.</span>who hath expresly treated thereof. But of the Greek
compute there have passed some learned dissertations not many years ago,
wherein the learned <i>Isacius Vossius</i> makes the nativity of the world to
anticipate the common account one thousand four hundred and forty years.</p>

<p>This Translation in ancient times was of great authority, by this many
of the Heathens received some notions of the Creation and the mighty
works of God; This in express terms is often followed by the
Evangelists, by the Apostles, and by our Saviour himself in the
quotations of the Old Testament. This for many years was used by the
Jews themselves, that is, such as did Hellenize and dispersedly dwelt
out of Palestine with the Greeks; and this also the succeeding
Christians and ancient Fathers observed; although there succeeded other
Greek versions, that is, of <i>Aquila</i>, <i>Theodosius</i> and <i>Symmachus</i>; for
the Latin translation of <i>Jerom</i>, called now the Vulgar, was about 800
years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span> after the Septuagint; although there was also a Latin translation
before, called the Italick version. Which was after lost upon the
general reception of the translation of Saint <i>Jerom</i>.<span class="sidenote">Pr√¶fat. in
Paralipom.</span> Which notwithstanding (as he himself acknowledgeth) had
been needless, if the Septuagint copys had remained pure, and as they
were first translated. But, (beside that different copys were used, that
<i>Alexandria</i> and <i>Egypt</i> followed the copy of <i>Hesychius</i>, <i>Antioch</i> and
<i>Constantinople</i> that of <i>Lucian</i> the Martyr, and others that of
<i>Origen</i>) the Septuagint was much depraved, not only from the errors of
Scribes, and the emergent corruptions of time, but malicious contrivance
of the Jews; as <i>Justin Martyr</i> hath declared, in his learned dialogue
<i>Tryphon</i>, and <i>Morinus</i> hath learnedly shewn from many confirmations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">De Hebr√¶i et Gr√¶ci textus sinceritate.</div>

<p>Whatsoever Interpretations there have been since, have been especially
effected with reference unto these, that is, the Greek and Hebrew text,
the Translators sometimes following the one, sometimes adhering unto the
other, according as they found them consonant unto truth, or most
correspondent unto the rules of faith. Now however it cometh to pass,
these two are very different in the enumeration of Genealogies, and
particular accounts of time; for in the second intervail, that is,
between the Flood and <i>Abraham</i>, there is by the Septuagint introduced
one <i>Cainan</i> to be the son of <i>Arphaxad</i> and father of <i>Salah</i>; whereas
in the Hebrew there is no mention of such a person, but <i>Arphaxad</i> is
set down to be the father of <i>Salah</i>. But in the first intervail, that
is, from the Creation unto the Flood, their disagreement is more
considerable; for therein the Greek exceedeth the Hebrew, and common
account almost 600 years. And &rsquo;tis indeed a thing not very strange, to
be at the difference of a third part, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span> so large and collective an
account, if we consider how differently they are set forth in minor and
less mistakable numbers. So in the Prophesie of <i>Jonah</i>, both in the
Hebrew and Latin text, it is said, Yet forty dayes and <i>Ninevy</i> shall be
overthrown: But the Septuagint saith plainly, and that in letters at
length, œÑœÅŒµ·øñœÇ ·º°ŒºŒ≠œÅŒ±œÇ that is, yet three dayes and <i>Ninevy</i> shall be
destroyed. Which is a difference not newly crept in, but an observation
very ancient, discussed by <i>Austin</i> and <i>Theodoret</i>, and was conceived
an error committed by the Scribe. Men therefore have raised different
computes of time, according as they have followed their different texts;
and so have left the history of times far more perplexed than Chronology
hath reduced.</p>

<p>Again, However the texts were plain, and might in their numerations
agree, yet were there no small difficulty to set down a determinable
Chronology, or establish from whence any fixed point of time. For the
doubts concerning the time of the Judges are inexplicable; that of the
Reigns and succession of Kings is as perplexed; it being uncertain
whether the years both of their lives and reigns ought to be taken as
compleat, or in their beginning and but currant accounts. Nor is it
unreasonable to make some doubt whether in the first ages and long lives
of our fathers, <i>Moses</i> doth not sometime account by full and round
numbers, whereas strictly taken they might be some few years above or
under; as in the age of <i>Noah</i>, it is delivered to be just five hundred
when he begat <i>Sem</i>; whereas perhaps he might be somewhat above or below
that round and compleat number. For the same way of speech is usual in
divers other expressions: Thus do we say the Septuagint, and using the
full and articulate number, do write the Translation of Seventy;
whereas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span> we have shewn before, the precise number was Seventy two. So is
it said that Christ was three days in the grave; according to that of
<i>Mathew</i>, as <i>Jonas</i> was three days and three nights in the Whales
belly, so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the
heart of the earth: which notwithstanding must be taken Synecdochically;
or by understanding a part for an whole day; for he remained but two
nights in the grave; for he was buried in the afternoon of the first
day, and arose very early in the morning on the third; that is, he was
interred in the eve of the Sabbath, and arose in the morning after it.</p>

<p>Moreover although the number of years be determined and rightly
understood, and there be without doubt a certain truth herein; yet the
text speaking obscurely or dubiously, there is oft-times no slender
difficulty at what point to begin or terminate the account. So when it
is said <i>Exod.</i> 12. the sojourning of the children of <i>Israel</i> who dwelt
in <i>Egypt</i> was 430 years, it cannot be taken strictly, and from their
first arrival into Egypt, for their habitation in that land was far
less; but the account must begin from the Covenant of God with
<i>Abraham</i>, and must also comprehend their sojourn in the land of
<i>Canaan</i>, according as is expressed, <i>Gal.</i> 3. The Covenant that was
confirmed before of God in Christ, the Law which was 430 years after
cannot disanul. Thus hath it also happened in the account of the 70
years of their captivity, according to that of <i>Jeremy</i>,<span class="sidenote10"><i>Chap.</i>
20.</span> This whole land shall be a desolation, and these nations shall
serve the King of <i>Babylon</i> 70 years. Now where to begin or end this
compute, ariseth no small difficulties; for there were three remarkable
captivities and deportations of the Jews. The first was in the third or
fourth year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span> of <i>Joachim</i>, and first of <i>Nabuchodonozor</i>, when <i>Daniel</i>
was carried away; the second in the reign of <i>Ieconiah</i>, and the eighth
year of the same King; the third and most deplorable to the reign of
<i>Zedechias</i> and in the nineteenth year of <i>Nabuchodonozor</i>, whereat both
the Temple and City were burned. Now such is the different conceit of
these times, that men have computed from all; but the probablest account
and most concordant unto the intention of <i>Ieremy</i>, is from the first of
<i>Nabuchodonozor</i> unto the first of King <i>Cyrus</i> over <i>Babylon</i>; although
the Prophet <i>Zachary</i> <span class="sidenote15"><i>Chap.</i> 1. 12.</span> accounteth from the last. O
Lord of hosts, How Long! Wilt thou not have mercy on <i>Ierusalem</i>,
against which thou hast had indignation these threescore and ten years?
for he maketh this expostulation in the second year of <i>Darius
Histaspes</i>, wherein he prophesied, which is about eighteen years in
account after the other.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The difficulties of</i> Daniels <i>70 Weeks</i>.</div>

<p>Thus also although there be a certain truth therein, yet is there no
easie doubt concerning the seventy weeks, or seventy times seven years
of <i>Daniel</i>; whether they have reference unto the nativity or passion of
our Saviour, and especially from whence, or what point of time they are
to be computed. For thus is it delivered by the Angel <i>Gabriel</i>: Seventy
weeks are determined upon the people; and again in the following verse:
Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the
Commandment to restore and to build <i>Ierusalem</i> unto the Messias the
Prince, shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks, the street
shall be built again, and the wall even in troublesome times; and after
threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off. Now the going out of
the Commandment to build the City, being the point from whence to
compute, there is no slender controversie when to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span> begin. For there are
no less than four several Edicts to this effect, the one in the first
year of <i>Cyrus</i>, the other in the second of <i>Darius</i>, the third and
fourth in the seventh, and in the twentieth of <i>Artaxerxes Longimanus</i>;
although as <i>Petavius</i> accounteth, it best accordeth unto the twenty
year of <i>Artaxerxes</i>, from whence <i>Nehemiah</i> deriveth his Commission.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Of our Bless. Saviours age at his Passion.</i></span> Now that computes are
made uncertainly with reference unto Christ, it is no wonder, since I
perceive the time of his Nativity is in controversie, and no less his
age at his Passion. For <i>Clemens</i> and <i>Tertullian</i> conceive he suffered
at thirty; but <i>Iren√¶us</i> a Father neerer his time, is further off in his
account, that is, between forty and fifty.</p>

<p><i>Longomontanus</i> a late Astronomer, endeavours to discover this secret
from Astronomical grounds, that is, the Apogeum of the Sun; conceiving
the Excentricity invariable, and the Apogeum yearly to move one scruple,
two seconds, fifty thirds, etc. Wherefore if in the time of
<i>Hipparchus</i>, that is, in the year of the <i>Iulian</i> period 4557 it was in
the fifth degree of <i>Gemini</i>, and in the daies of <i>Tycho Brahe</i>, that is
in the year of our Lord 1588, or of the world 5554, the same was removed
unto the fift degree of <i>Cancer</i>; by the proportion of its motion, it
was at the Creation first in the beginning of <i>Aries</i>, and the Perigeum
or nearest point in <i>Libra</i>. But this conceit how ingenious or subtile
soever, is not of satisfaction; it being not determinable, or yet agreed
in what time precisely the Apogeum absolveth one degree, as <i>Petavius</i>
<span class="sidenote">De Doctrina temporum 1.4.</span> hath also delivered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p><p>Lastly, However these or other difficulties intervene, and that we
cannot satisfie our selves in the exact compute of time, yet may we sit
down with the common and usual account; nor are these differences
deroga<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>tory unto the Advent or Passion of Christ, unto which indeed they
all do seem to point, for the Prophecies concerning our Saviour were
indefinitely delivered before that of <i>Daniel</i>; so was that pronounced
unto <i>Eve</i> in paradise, that after of <i>Balaam</i>, those of <i>Isaiah</i> and
the Prophets, and that memorable one of <i>Iacob</i>, the Scepter shall not
depart from <i>Israel</i> untill <i>Shilo</i> come; which time notwithstanding it
did not define at all. In what year therefore soever, either from the
destruction of the Temple, from the re-edifying thereof, from the flood,
or from the Creation he appeared, certain it is, that in the fulness of
time he came. When he therefore came is not so considerable, as that he
is come: in the one there is consolation, in the other no satisfaction.
The greater Quere is, when he will come again; and yet indeed it is no
Quere at all: for that is never to be known, and therefore vainly
enquired: &rsquo;tis a professed and authentick obscurity, unknown to all but
to the omniscience of the Almighty. Certainly the ends of things are
wrapt up in the hands of God, he that undertakes the knowledge thereof,
forgets his own beginning, and disclaims his principles of earth. No man
knows the end of the world, nor assuredly of any thing in it: God sees
it, because unto his Eternity it is present; he knoweth the ends of us,
but not of himself: and because he knows not this, he knoweth all
things, and his knowledge is endless, even in the object of himself.</p>

<p class="hang">Of mens Enquiries in what season or Point
of the Zodiack it began, that as they are
generally made, they are in vain, and as
particularly, uncertain.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><i>The world began in all the four quarters of the year.</i></div>

<p>Concerning the Seasons, that is, the quarters of the year, some are
ready to enquire, others to determine, in what season, whether in the
Autumn, Spring, Winter or Summer the World had its beginning. Wherein we
affirm, that as the question is generally, and in respect of the whole
earth proposed, it is with manifest injury unto reason in any particular
determined; because when ever the world had its beginning it was created
in all these four. For, as we have elsewhere delivered, whatsoever sign
the Sun possesseth (whose recess or vicinity defineth the quarters of
the year) those four seasons were actually existent; it being the nature
of that Luminary to distinguish the several seasons of the year; all
which it maketh at one time in the whole earth, and successively in any
part thereof. Thus if we suppose the Sun created in Libra, in which sign
unto some it maketh Autumn; at the same time it had been Winter unto the
Northern-pole, for unto them at that time the Sun beginneth to be
invisible, and to shew it self again unto the Pole of the South. Unto
the position of a right Sphere or directly under the √Üquator, it had
been Summer; for unto that situation the Sun is at that time vertical.
Unto the latitude of Capricorn, or the Winter Solstice it had been
Spring; for unto that position it had been in a middle point, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
of ascent, or approximation, but unto the latitude of Cancer or the
Summer Solstice it had been Autumn; for then had it been placed in a
middle point, and that of descent, or elongation.</p>

<p>And if we shall take it literally what <i>Moses</i> described popularly, this
was also the constitution of the first day. For when it was evening unto
one longitude, it was morning unto another; when night unto one, day
unto another. And therefore that question, whether our Saviour shall
come again in the twilight (as is conceived he arose) or whether he
shall come upon us in the night, according to the comparison of a thief,
or the <i>Jewish</i> tradition, that he will come about the time of their
departure out of <i>√Ügypt</i>, when they eat the Passover, and the Angel
passed by the doors of their houses; this Quere I say needeth not
further dispute. For if the earth be almost every where inhabited, and
his coming (as Divinity affirmed) must needs be unto all; then must the
time of his appearance be both in the day and night. For if unto
<i>Jerusalem</i>, or what part of the world soever he shall appear in the
night, at the same time unto the <i>Antipodes</i>, it must be day; if
twilight unto them, broad day unto the <i>Indians</i>; if noon unto them, yet
night unto the <i>Americans</i>: and so with variety according unto various
habitations, or different positions of the Sphere, as will be easily
conceived by those who understand the affections of different
habitations, and the conditions of <i>Ant√¶ci</i>, <i>Peri√¶ci</i>, and <i>Antipodes</i>.
And so although he appear in the night, yet may the day of Judgement or
Dooms-day well retain that name; for that implieth one revolution of the
Sun, which maketh the day and night, and that one natural day.
<span class="sidenote15">ŒùœÖœáŒ∏ŒÆŒºŒµœÅŒøŒΩ</span> And yet to speak strictly, if (as the Apostle
affirmeth)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span> we shall be changed in the twinckling of an eye (and as the
Schools determine) the destruction of the world shall not be successive
but in an instant; we cannot properly apply thereto the usual
distinctions of time; called that twelve hours, which admits not the
parts thereof, or use at all the name of time, when the nature thereof
shall perish.</p>

<p>But if the enquiry be made unto a particular place, and the question
determined unto some certain Meridian; as namely, unto <i>Mesopotamia</i>
wherein the seat of paradice is presumed, the Query becomes more
reasonable, and is indeed in nature also determinable. Yet positively to
define that season, there is no slender difficulty; for some contend
that it began in the Spring; as (beside <i>Eusebius</i>, <i>Ambrose</i>, <i>Bede</i>,
and <i>Theodoret</i>) some few years past <i>Henrico Philippi</i> in his
Chronology of the Scripture. Others are altogether for Autumn; and from
hence do our Chronologers commence their compute; as may be observed in
<i>Helvicus</i>, <i>Jo. Scaliger</i>, <i>Calvisius</i>, and <i>Petavius</i>.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III_PE_VI" id="CHAPTER_III_PE_VI">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

<p class="hang">Of the Divisions of the seasons and four Quarters
of the year, according unto Astronomers
and Physitians; that the common
compute of the Ancients, and which is
still retained by some is very questionable.</p>


<p>As for the divisions of the year, and the quartering out this remarkable
standard of time, there have passed especially two distinctions; the
first in frequent use with Astronomers, according to the cardinal
intersections of the Zodiack, that is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span> the two √Üquinoctials and both
the Solstitial points; defining that time to be the Spring of the year,
wherein the Sun doth pass from the √Üquinox of Aries unto the Solstice of
Cancer; the time between the Solstice and the √Üquinox of Libra, Summer;
from thence unto the Solstice of Capricornus, Autumn; and from thence
unto the √Üquinox of Aries again, Winter. Now this division although it
be regular and equal, is not universal; for it includeth not those
latitudes which have the seasons of the year double; as have the
inhabitants under the Equator, or else between the Tropicks.
<span class="sidenote"><i>Between the Tropicks two Summers in a year.</i></span> For unto them the Sun is
vertical twice a year, making two distinct Summers in the different
points of verticality. So unto those which live under the √Üquator, when
the sun is in the √Üquinox it is Summer, in which points it maketh Spring
or Autumn unto us; and unto them it is also Winter when the Sun is in
either Tropick; whereas unto us it maketh always Summer in the one. And
the like will happen unto those habitations, which are between the
Tropicks and the √Üquator.</p>

<p>A second and more sensible division there is observed by <i>Hippocrates</i>,
and most of the ancient <i>Greeks</i>, according to the rising and setting of
divers stars; dividing the year, and establishing the account of seasons
from usual alterations, and sensible mutations in the air, discovered
upon the rising and setting of those stars, accounting the Spring from
the √Üquinoxial point of Aries; from the rising of the Pleiades, or the
several stars on the back of Taurus, Summer; from the rising of
Arcturus, a star between the thighs of Bootes, Autumn; and from the
setting of the Pleiades, Winter. Of these divisions because they were
unequal, they were fain to subdivide the two larger portions, that is of
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span> Summer and Winter quarters; the first part of the Summer they named
Œ∏Œ≠œÅŒøœÇ, the second unto the rising of the Dog-star, ·Ω§œÅŒ±, from thence unto
the setting of Arcturus, ·ΩÄœÄœéœÅŒ±. The Winter they divided also into three
parts; the first part, or that of seed time they named œÉœÄœåœÅŒµœÑŒøŒΩ, the
middle or proper Winter, œáŒµŒπŒº·ΩºŒΩ, the last, which was their planting or
grafting time œÜœÖœÑŒ±ŒªŒØŒ±ŒΩ. This way of division was in former ages
received, is very often mentioned in Poets, translated from one Nation
to another; from the <i>Greeks</i> unto the <i>Latines</i> as is received by good
Authors; and delivered by Physitians, even unto our times.</p>

<p>Now of these two, although the first in some latitude may be retained,
yet is not the other in any to be admitted. For in regard of time (as we
elsewhere declare) the stars do vary their longitudes, and consequently
the times of their ascension and descension. That star which is the term
of numeration, or point from whence we commence the account, altering
his site and longitude in process of time, and removing from West to
East, almost one degree in the space of 72 years, so that the same star,
since the age of <i>Hippocrates</i> who used this account, is removed in
<i>consequentia</i> about 27 degrees. Which difference of their longitudes,
doth much diversifie the times of their ascents, and rendereth the
account unstable which shall proceed thereby.</p>

<p>Again, In regard of different latitudes, this cannot be a setled rule,
or reasonably applied unto many Nations. For whereas the setting of the
Pleiades or seven stars, is designed the term of Autumn, and the
beginning of Winter; unto some latitudes these stars do never set, as
unto all beyond 67 degrees. And if in several and far distant latitudes
we observe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span> the same star as a common term of account unto both, we
shall fall upon an unexpected, but an unsufferable absurdity; and by the
same account it will be Summer unto us in the North, before it be so
unto those, which unto us are Southward, and many degrees approaching
nearer the Sun. For if we consult the Doctrine of the sphere, and
observe the ascension of the Pleiades, which maketh the beginning of
Summer, we shall discover that in the latitude of 40, these stars arise
in the 16 degree of Taurus; but in the latitude of 50, they ascend in
the eleventh degree of the same sign, that is, 5 dayes sooner; so shall
it be Summer unto <i>London</i>, before it be unto <i>Toledo</i>, and begin to
scorch in <i>England</i>, before it grow hot in <i>Spain</i>.</p>

<p>This is therefore no general way of compute, nor reasonable to be
derived from one Nation unto another; the defect of which consideration
hath caused divers errors in Latine poets, translating these expressions
from the <i>Greeks</i>; and many difficulties even in the <i>Greeks</i>
themselves; which living in divers latitudes, yet observed the same
compute. So that to make them out, we are fain to use distinctions;
sometime computing cosmically what they intended heliacally: and
sometime in the same expression accounting the rising heliacally, the
setting cosmically. Otherwise it will be hardly made out, what is
delivered by approved Authors; and is an observation very considerable
unto those which meet with such expressions, as they are very frequent
in the poets of elder times, especially <i>Hesiod</i>, <i>Aratus</i>, <i>Virgil</i>,
<i>Ovid</i>, <i>Manilius</i>; and Authors Geoponical, or which have treated <i>de re
rustica</i>, as <i>Constantine</i>, <i>Marcus Cato</i>, <i>Columella</i>, <i>Palladius</i> and
<i>Varro</i>.</p>

<p>Lastly, The absurdity in making common unto many Nations those
considerations whose verity is but parti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>cular unto some, will more
evidently appear, if we examine the Rules and Precepts of some one
climate, and fall upon consideration with what incongruity they are
transferrible unto others. Thus is it advised by <i>Hesiod</i>.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div></div>

<p>Implying hereby the Heliacal ascent and Cosmical descent of those stars.
Now herein he setteth down a rule to begin harvest at the arise of the
Pleiades; which in his time was in the beginning of <i>May</i>. This indeed
was consonant unto the clime wherein he lived, and their harvest began
about that season: but is not appliable unto our own, for therein we are
so far from expecting an harvest, that our Barley-seed is not ended.
Again, correspondent unto the rule of <i>Hesiod</i>, <i>Virgil</i> affordeth
another,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="line"><i>Ante tibi Eo√¶ Atlantides abscondantur,</i></div>
<div class="line"><i>Debita quam sulcis committas semina.</i></div>
</div></div>

<p>Understanding hereby their Cosmical descent, or their setting when the
Sun ariseth, and not their Heliacal obscuration, or their inclusion in
the lustre of the Sun, as <i>Servius</i> upon this place would have it; for
at that time these stars are many signs removed from that luminary. Now
herein he strictly adviseth, not to begin to sow before the setting of
these stars; which notwithstanding without injury to agriculture, cannot
be observed in <i>England</i>; for they set unto us about the 12 of November,
when our Seed-time is almost ended.</p>

<p>And this diversity of clime and c≈ìlestial observations, precisely
observed unto certain stars and moneths, hath not only overthrown the
deductions of one Nation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span> to another, but hath perturbed the observation
of festivities and statary Solemnities, even with the <i>Jews</i> themselves.
For unto them it was commanded that at their entrance into the land of
<i>Canaan</i>, in the fourteenth of the first moneth (that is <i>Abib</i> or
<i>Nisan</i> which is Spring with us) they should observe the celebration of
the Passover; and on the morrow after, which is the fifteenth day, the
feast of unleavened bread; and in the sixteenth of the same moneth, that
they should offer the first sheaf of the harvest. Now all this was
feasible and of an easie possibility in the land of <i>Canaan</i>, or
latitude of <i>Jerusalem</i>; for so it is observed by several Authors in
later times; and is also testified by holy Scripture in times very far
before. For when the children of <i>Israel</i> passed the river <i>Jordan</i>,
<span class="sidenote10">Josh. 3.</span> it is delivered by way of parenthesis, that the river
overfloweth its banks in the time of harvest; which is conceived the
time wherein they passed; and it is after delivered,<span class="sidenote10"> Josh. 5.</span> that
in the fourteenth day they celebrated the Passover: which according to
the Law of <i>Moses</i> was to be observed in the first moneth, or moneth of
<i>Abib</i>.</p>

<p>And therefore it is no wonder, what is related by <i>Luke</i>, that the
Disciples upon the <i>Deuteroproton</i>, as they passed by, plucked the ears
of corn. <span class="sidenote"><i>What the Sabbaton Deuteroproton</i>, Luk. 6. <i>was</i>.</span> For the
<i>Deuteroproton</i> or second first Sabbath, was the first Sabbath after the
Deutera or second of the Passover, which was the sixteenth of <i>Nisan</i> or
<i>Abib</i>. And this is also evidenced from the received construction of the
first and latter rain. I will give you the rain of your land in his due
season, the first rain and the latter rain. <span class="sidenote10"><i>Deut.</i> 11.</span> For the
first rain fell upon the seed-time about October, and was to make the
seed to root, the latter was to fill the ear, and fell in Abib or March,
the first moneth: according as is expressed. <span class="sidenote10"><i>Joel</i> 2.</span> And he will
cause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span> to come down for you the rain, the former rain and the latter
rain in the first moneth; that is the moneth of <i>Abib</i> wherein the
Passover was observed. This was the Law of <i>Moses</i>, and this in the land
of <i>Canaan</i> was well observed, according to the first institution: but
since their dispersion and habitation in Countries, whose constitutions
admit not such tempestivity of harvests; and many not before the latter
end of Summer; notwithstanding the advantage of their Lunary account,
and intercalary moneth Veader, affixed unto the beginning of the year,
there will be found a great disparity in their observations; nor can
they strictly and at the same season with their forefathers observe the
commands of God.</p>

<p>To add yet further, those Geoponical rules and precepts of Agriculture
which are delivered by divers Authors, are not to be generally received;
but respectively understood unto climes whereto they are determined. For
whereas one adviseth to sow this or that grain at one season, a second
to set this or that at another, it must be conceived relatively, and
every Nation must have its Country Farm; for herein we may observe a
manifest and visible difference, not only in the seasons of harvest, but
in the grains themselves. For with us Barley-harvest is made after
wheat-harvest, but with the <i>Israelites</i> and <i>√Ügyptians</i> it was
otherwise; so is it expressed by way of priority, <i>Ruth</i> the 2. So
<i>Ruth</i> kept fast by the maidens of <i>Boaz</i> to glean unto the end of
Barley-harvest and of Wheat-harvest, which in the plague of hayl in
<i>√Ügypt</i> is more plainly delivered, <i>Exod.</i> 9. And the Flax and the
Barley were smitten, for the Barley was in the ear and the Flax was
bolled, but the Wheat and the Rye were not smitten, for they were not
grown up.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>And thus we see the account established upon the arise or descent of the
stars can be no reasonable rule unto distant Nations at all, and by
reason of their retrogression but temporary unto any one. Nor must these
respective expressions be entertained in absolute considerations; for so
distinct is the relation, and so artificial the habitude of this
inferiour globe unto the superiour, and even of one thing in each unto
the other, that general rules are dangerous, and applications most safe
that run with security of circumstance. Which rightly to effect, is
beyond the subtlety of sense, and requires the artifice of reason.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV_PE_VI" id="CHAPTER_IV_PE_VI">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

<p class="hang">Of some computation of days and deductions
of one part of the year unto another.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><i>That the days decrease and increase unequally.</i></div>

<p>Fourthly, There are certain vulgar opinions concerning days of the year,
and conclusions popularly deduced from certain days of the moneth: men
commonly believing the days increase and decrease equally in the whole
year: which notwithstanding is very repugnant unto truth. For they
increase in the moneth of March, almost as much as in the two moneths of
January and February: and decrease as much in September, as they do in
July and August. For the days increase or decrease according to the
declination of the Sun, that is, its deviation Northward or Southward
from the √Üquator. Now this digression is not equal but near the
√Üquinoxial intersections, it is right and greater, near the Solstices
more oblique and lesser. So from the eleventh of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span> March the vernal
√Üquinox, unto the eleventh of April the Sun declineth to the North
twelve degrees; from the eleventh of April unto the eleventh of May but
eight, from thence unto the fifteenth of June, or the Summer Solstice
but three and a half: all which make twenty two degrees and an half, the
greatest declination of the Sun.</p>

<p>And this inequality in the declination of the Sun in the Zodiack or line
of life, is correspondent unto the growth or declination of man. For
setting out from infancy we increase not equally, or regularly attain to
our state or perfection: nor when we descend from our state, is our
declination equal, or carrieth us with even paces unto the grave. For as
<i>Hippocrates</i> affirmeth, a man is hottest in the first day of his life,
and coldest in the last: his natural heat setteth forth most vigorously
at first, and declineth most sensibly at last. <span class="sidenote"><i>The natural proportion of humane growth</i>, etc.</span>
<span class="sidenote"><i>In the world,</i></span>And so though the growth of man end not perhaps until twenty one, yet is his
stature more advanced in the first septenary than in the second, and in
the second, more than in the third, and more indeed in the first seven
years, than in the fourteen succeeding; for what stature we attain unto
at seven years, we do sometimes but double, most times come short of at
one and twenty. And so do we decline again: For in the latter age upon
the Tropick and first descension from our solstice, we are scarce
sensible of declination: but declining further, our decrement
accelerates, we set apace, and in our last days precipitate into our
graves. <span class="sidenote"><i>and in the womb.</i></span> And thus are also our progressions in
the womb, that is, our formation, motion, our birth or exclusion. For
our formation is quickly effected, our motion appeareth later, and our
exclusion very long after: if that be true which <i>Hippocrates</i> and
<i>Avicenna</i> have declared,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span> that the time of our motion is double unto
that of formation, and that of exclusion treble unto that of motion. As
if the Infant be formed at thirty five days, it moveth at seventy, and
is born the two hundred and tenth day, that is, the seventh month; or if
it receives not formation before forty five days, it moveth the
ninetieth day, and is excluded in the two hundred and seventy, that is,
the ninth month.</p>

<p>There are also certain popular prognosticks drawn from festivals in the
Calender, and conceived opinions of certain days in months; so is there
a general tradition in most parts of <i>Europe</i>, that inferreth the
coldness of succeeding winter from the shining of the Sun upon
<i>Candlemas</i> day, or the Purification of the Virgin <i>Mary</i>, according to
the proverbial distich,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="line"><i>Si Sol splendescat Mari√¢ purificante,</i></div>
<div class="line"><i>Major erit glacies post festum quam fuit ante.</i></div>
</div></div>

<p>So is it usual among us to qualifie and conditionate the twelve months
of the year, answerably unto the temper of the twelve days in
<i>Christmas</i>; and to ascribe unto March certain borrowed days from April;
all which men seem to believe upon annual experience of their own, and
the received traditions of their fore-fathers.</p>

<p>Now it is manifest, and most men likewise know, that the Calenders of
these computers, and the accounts of these days are very different; the
Greeks dissenting from the Latins, and the Latins from each other; the
one observing the <i>Julian</i> or ancient account, as great <i>Britain</i> and
part of <i>Germany</i>; the other adhering to the <i>Gregorian</i> or new account,
as <i>Italy</i>, <i>France</i>, <i>Spain</i>, and the united Provinces of the
Netherlands. Now this later account by ten days at least anticipateth
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span> other; so that before the one beginneth the account, the other is
past it; yet in the several calculations, the same events seem true, and
men with equal opinion of verity, expect and confess a confirmation from
them all. Whereby is evident the Oraculous authority of tradition, and
the easie seduction of men, neither enquiring into the verity of the
substance, nor reforming upon repugnance of circumstance.</p>

<p>And thus may divers easily be mistaken who superstitiously observe
certain times, or set down unto themselves an observation of unfortunate
months, or dayes, or hours; As did the <i>Egyptians</i>, two in every month,
and the <i>Romans</i>, the days after the Nones, Ides and Calends. And thus
the Rules of Navigators must often fail, setting down, as <i>Rhodiginus</i>
observeth, suspected and ominous days in every month, as the first and
seventh of March, the fift and sixt of April, the sixt, the twelfth and
fifteenth of February. For the accounts hereof in these months are very
different in our days, and were different with several Nations in Ages
past; and how strictly soever the account be made, and even by the
self-same Calender, yet is it possible that Navigators may be out. For
so were the Hollanders, who passing Westward through <i>fretum le Mayre</i>,
and compassing the Globe, upon their return into their own Country,
found that they had lost a day. For if two men at the same time travel
from the same place, the one Eastward, the other Westward round about
the earth, and meet in the same place from whence the first set forth;
it will so fall out, that he which hath moved Eastward against the
diurnal motion of the Sun, by anticipating dayly something of its circle
with his own motion, will gaine one day; but he that travelleth
Westward, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span> motion of the Sun, by seconding its revolution,
shall lose or come short a day. And therefore also upon these grounds
that <i>Delos</i> was seated in the middle of the earth, it was no exact
decision, because two Eagles let fly East and West by <i>Jupiter</i>, their
meeting fell out just in the Island <i>Delos</i>.</p>

<p class="hang">A Digression of the wisdom of God in the
site and motion of the Sun.</p>


<p>Having thus beheld the ignorance of man in some things, his error and
blindness in others, that is, in the measure of duration both of years
and seasons, let us a while admire the Wisdom of God in this
distinguisher of times, and visible Deity (as some have termed it) the
Sun. Which though some from its glory adore, and all for its benefits
admire, we shall advance from other considerations, and such as
illustrate the artifice of its Maker. Nor do we think we can excuse the
duty of our knowledge, if we only bestow the flourish of Poetry hereon,
or those commendatory conceits which popularly set forth the eminency of
this creature; except we ascend unto subtiler considerations, and such
as rightly understood, convincingly declare the wisdom of the Creator.
Which since a Spanish Physitian <span class="sidenote">Valerius de Philos. <i>Sacr.</i></span>hath
begun, we will enlarge with our deductions; and this we shall endeavour
from two considerations; its proper situation, and wisely ordered
motion.</p>

<p>And first we cannot pass over his providence, in that it moveth at all;
for had it stood still, and were it fixed like the earth, there had been
then no distinction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span> of times, either of day or year, of Spring, of
Autumn, of Summer, or of Winter; for these seasons are defined by the
motions of the Sun; when that approacheth neare our Zenith, or vertical
Point, we call it Summer, when furthest off, Winter, when in the middle
spaces, Spring or Autumn, whereas remaining in one place these
distinctions had ceased, and consequently the generation of all things
depending on their vicissitudes; making in one hemisphere a perpetual
Summer, in the other a deplorable and comfortless Winter. <span class="sidenote"><i>What the
natural day is.</i></span> And thus had it also been continual day unto some, and
perpetual night unto others; for the day is defined by the abode of the
Sun above the Horizon, and the night by its continuance below; so should
we have needed another Sun, one to illustrate our Hemisphere, a second
to enlighten the other; which inconvenience will ensue in what site
soever we place it, whether in the Poles, or the √Üquator, or between
them both; no spherical body of what bigness soever illuminating the
whole sphere of another, although it illuminate something more than half
of a lesser, according unto the doctrine of the Opticks.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Every part of the Earth habitable.</i></div>

<p>His wisdom is again discernable, not only in that it moveth at all, and
in its bare motion, but wonderful in contriving the line of its
revolution; which is so prudently effected, that by a vicissitude in one
body and light it sufficeth the whole earth, affording thereby a
possible or pleasurable habitation in every part thereof; and this is
the line Ecliptick; all which to effect by any other circle it had been
impossible. For first, if we imagine the Sun to make his course out of
the Ecliptick, and upon a line without any obliquity, let it be
conceived within that Circle, that is either on the √Üquator, or else on
either side: (For if we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span> should place it either in the Meridian or
Colures, beside the subversion of its course from East to West, there
would ensue the like incommodities.) Now if we conceive the sun to move
between the obliquity of this Ecliptick in a line upon one side of the
√Üquator, then would the Sun be visible but unto one pole, that is the
same which was nearest unto it. So that unto the one it would be
perpetual day; unto the other perpetual night; the one would be
oppressed with constant heat, the other with insufferable cold; and so
the defect of alternation would utterly impugn the generation of all
things; which naturally require a vicissitude of heat to their
production, and no less to their increase and conservation.</p>

<p>But if we conceive it to move in the √Üquator; first unto a parallel
sphere, or such as have the pole for their Zenith, it would have made
neither perfect day nor night. For being in the √Üquator it would
intersect their Horizon, and be half above and half beneath it: or
rather it would have made perpetual night to both; for though in regard
of the rational Horizon, which bisecteth the Globe into equal parts, the
Sun in the √Üquator would intersect the Horizon: yet in respect of the
sensible Horizon (which is defined by the eye) the Sun would be visible
unto neither. For if as ocular witnesses report, and some also write, by
reason of the convexity of the Earth, the eye of man under the √Üquator
cannot discover both the poles; neither would the eye under the poles
discover the Sun in the √Üquator. Thus would there nothing fructifie
either near or under them: The Sun being Horizontal to the poles, and of
no considerable altitude unto parts a reasonable distance from them.
Again, unto a right sphere, or such as dwell under the √Üquator,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
although it made a difference in day and night, yet would it not make
any distinction of seasons: for unto them it would be constant Summer,
it being alwaies vertical, and never deflecting from them: So had there
been no fructification at all, and the Countries subjected would be as
uninhabitable, as indeed antiquity conceived them.</p>

<p>Lastly, It moving thus upon the √Üquator, unto what position soever,
although it had made a day, yet could it have made no year: for it could
not have had those two motions now ascribed unto it, that is, from East
to West, whereby it makes the day, and likewise from West to East,
whereby the year is computed. For according to received Astronomy, the
poles of the √Üquator are the same with those of the <i>Primum Mobile</i>. Now
it is impossible that on the same circle, having the same poles, both
these motions from opposite terms should be at the same time performed;
all which is salved, if we allow an obliquity in his annual motion, and
conceive him to move upon the Poles of the Zodiack, distant from these
of the world 23 degrees and an half. Thus may we discern the necessity
of its obliquity, and how inconvenient its motion had been upon a circle
parallel to the √Üquator, or upon the √Üquator it self.</p>

<p>Now with what Providence this obliquity is determined, we shall perceive
upon the ensuing inconveniences from any deviation. For first, if its
obliquity had been less (as instead of twenty three degrees, twelve or
the half thereof) the vicissitude of seasons appointed for the
generation of all things, would surely have been too short; for
different seasons would have hudled upon each other; and unto some it
had not been much better than if it had moved on the √Üquator.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>But had the obliquity been greater than now it is, as double, or of 40
degrees; several parts of the earth had not been able to endure the
disproportionable differences of seasons, occasioned by the great
recess, and distance of the Sun. For unto some habitations the Summer
would have been extream hot, and the Winter extream cold; likewise the
Summer temperate unto some, but excessive and in extremity unto others,
as unto those who should dwell under the Tropick of Cancer, as then
would do some part of <i>Spain</i>, or ten degrees beyond, as <i>Germany</i>, and
some part of <i>England</i>; who would have Summers as now the <i>Moors</i> of
<i>Africa</i>. For the Sun would sometime be vertical unto them: but they
would have Winters like those beyond the Artick Circle; for in that
season the Sun would be removed above 80 degrees from them. Again, it
would be temperate to some habitations in the Summer, but very extream
in the Winter: temperate to those in two or three degrees beyond the
Artick Circle, as now it is unto us; for they would be equidistant from
that Tropick, even as we are from this at present. But the Winter would
be extream, the Sun being removed above an hundred degrees, and so
consequently would not be visible in their Horizon, no position of
sphere discovering any star distant above 90 degrees, which is the
distance of every Zenith from the Horizon. And thus if the obliquity of
this Circle had been less, the vicissitude of seasons had been so small
as not to be distinguished; if greater, so large and disproportionable
as not to be endured.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A competent distinction of seasons necessary, and why.</i></div>

<p>Now for its situation, although it held this Ecliptick line, yet had it
been seated in any other Orb, inconveniences would ensue of condition
like the former; for had it been placed in the lowest sphere of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
Moon, the year would have consisted but of one month; for in that space
of time it would have passed through every part of the Ecliptick: so
would there have been no reasonable distinction of seasons required for
the generation and fructifying of all things; contrary seasons which
destroy the effects of one another, so suddenly succeeding. Besides by
this vicinity unto the earth, its heat had been intollerable; for if (as
many affirm) there is a different sense of heat from the different
points of its proper Orb, and that in the Apogeum or highest point
(which happeneth in Cancer) it is not so hot under that Tropick, on this
side the √Üquator, as unto the other side in the Perigeum or lowest part
of the Eccentrick (which happeneth in Capricornus) surely being placed
in an Orb far lower, its heat would be unsufferable, nor needed we a
fable to set the world on fire.</p>

<p>But had it been placed in the highest Orb, or that of the eighth sphere,
there had been none but <i>Platoes</i> year, and a far less distinction of
seasons; for one year had then been many, and according unto the slow
revolution of that Orb which absolveth not his course in many thousand
years, no man had lived to attain the account thereof. These are the
inconveniences ensuing upon its situation in the extream orbs, and had
it been placed in the middle orbs of the Planets, there would have
ensued absurdities of a middle nature unto them.</p>

<p>Now whether we adhere unto the hypothesis of <i>Copernicus</i>, affirming the
earth to move, and the Sun to stand still; or whether we hold, as some
of late have concluded, from the spots in the Sun, which appear and
disappear again; that besides the revolution it maketh with its Orbs, it
hath also a dinetical motion, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span> rowls upon its own Poles, whether I
say we affirm these or no, the illations before mentioned are not
thereby infringed. We therefore conclude this contemplation, and are not
afraid to believe, it may be literally said of the wisdom of God, what
men will have but figuratively spoken of the works of Christ; that if
the wonders thereof were duly described, the whole world, that is, all
within the last circumference, would not contain them. For as his Wisdom
is infinite, so cannot the due expressions thereof be finite, and if the
world comprise him not, neither can it comprehend the story of him.</p>

<p class="hang">Concerning the vulgar opinion, that the Earth
was slenderly peopled before the Flood.</p>


<p>Beside the slender consideration men of latter times do hold of the
first ages, it is commonly opinioned, and at first thought generally
imagined, that the earth was thinly inhabited, at least not remotely
planted before the flood; whereof there being two opinions, which seem
to be of some extremity, the one too largely extending, the other too
narrowly contracting the populosity of those times; we shall not pass
over this point without some enquiry into it.</p>

<p>Now for the true enquiry thereof, the means are as obscure as the
matter, which being naturally to be explored by History, Humane or
Divine, receiveth thereby no small addition of obscurity. For as for
humane relations, they are so fabulous in <i>Deucalions</i> flood, that they
are of little credit about <i>Ogyges</i> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span> <i>Noahs</i>. For the Heathens (as
<i>Varro</i> accounteth) make three distinctions of time: the first from the
beginning of the world unto the general Deluge of <i>Ogyges</i>, they term
<i>Adelon</i>, that is, a time not much unlike that which was before time,
immanifest and unknown; because thereof there is almost nothing or very
obscurely delivered: for though divers Authors have made some mention of
the Deluge, as <i>Manethon</i> the <i>Egyptian</i> Priest, <i>Xenophon</i> de
√¶quivocis, <i>Fabius Pictor</i> de Aureo seculo, <i>Mar. Cato</i> de originibus,
and <i>Archilochus</i> the Greek, who introduceth also the Testimony of
<i>Moses</i> in his fragment <i>de temporibus</i>: yet have they delivered no
account of what preceded or went before. <i>Josephus</i> I confess in his
Discourse against <i>Appion</i> induceth the antiquity of the <i>Jews</i> unto the
flood, and before from the testimony of humane Writers; insisting
especially upon <i>Maseus</i> of <i>Damascus</i>, <i>Jeronimus √Ügyptius</i>, and
<i>Berosus</i>; and confirming the long duration of their lives, not only
from these, but the authority of <i>Hesiod</i>, <i>Erathius</i>, <i>Hellanicus</i> and
<i>Agesilaus</i>. <i>Berosus</i> the <i>Chaldean</i> Priest, writes most plainly,
mentioning the city of <i>Enos</i>, the name of <i>Noah</i> and his Sons, the
building of the Ark, and also the place of its landing. And <i>Diodorus
Siculus</i> hath in his third book a passage, which examined, advanceth as
high as <i>Adam</i>: for the <i>Chaldeans</i>, saith he, derive the Original of
their Astronomy and letters forty three thousand years before the
Monarchy of <i>Alexander</i> the Great: now the years whereby they computed
the antiquity of their letters, being as <i>Xenophon</i> interprets to be
accounted Lunary: the compute will arise unto the time of <i>Adam</i>. For
forty three thousand Lunary years make about three thousand six hundred
thirty four years, which answereth the Chronology of time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span> from the
beginning of the world unto the reign of <i>Alexander</i>, as <i>Annius</i> of
<i>Viterbo</i> computeth in his Comment upon <i>Berosus</i>.</p>

<p>The second space or interval of time is accounted from the flood unto
the first Olympiad, that is, the year of the world 3174, which extendeth
unto the days of <i>Isaiah</i> the Prophet, and some twenty years before the
foundation of <i>Rome</i>: this they term <i>Mythicon</i> or fabulous, because the
account thereof, especially of the first part, is fabulously or
imperfectly delivered. Hereof some things have been briefly related by
the Authors above mentioned: more particularly by <i>Dares Phrygius</i>,
<i>Dictys Cretensis</i>, <i>Herodotus</i>, <i>Diodorus Siculus</i>, and <i>Trogus
Pompeius</i>; the most famous <i>Greek</i> Poets lived also in this interval, as
<i>Orpheus</i>, <i>Linus</i>, <i>Mus√¶us</i>, <i>Homer</i>, <i>Hesiod</i>; and herein are
comprehended the grounds and first inventions of Poetical fables, which
were also taken up by historical Writers, perturbing the <i>Chaldean</i> and
<i>Egyptian</i> Records with fabulous additions; and confounding their names
and stories, with their own inventions.</p>

<p>The third time succeeding until their present ages, they term
<i>Historicon</i>, that is, such wherein matters have been more truly
historified, and may therefore be believed. Of these times also have
been written <i>Herodotus</i>, <i>Thucydides</i>, <i>Xenophon</i>, <i>Diodorus</i>; and both
of these and the other preceding such as have delivered universal
Histories or Chronologies; as (to omit <i>Philo</i>, whose Narrations concern
the <i>Hebrews</i>) <i>Eusebius</i>, <i>Julius Africanus</i>, <i>Orosius</i>, <i>Ado</i> of
<i>Vienna</i>, <i>Marianus Scotus</i>, <i>Historia tripartita</i>, <i>Urspergensis</i>,
<i>Carion</i>, <i>Pineda</i>, <i>Salian</i>, and with us Sir <i>Walter Raleigh</i>.</p>

<p>Now from the first hereof that most concerneth us, we have little or no
assistance; the fragments and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span> broken records hereof inforcing not at
all our purpose. And although some things not usually observed, may be
from thence collected, yet do they not advantage our discourse, nor any
way make evident the point in hand. For the second, though it directly
concerns us not, yet in regard of our last medium and some illustrations
therein, we shall be constrained to make some use thereof. As for the
last, it concerns us not at all; for treating of times far below us, it
can no way advantage us. And though divers in this last Age have also
written of the first, as all that have delivered the general accounts of
time, yet are their Tractates little auxiliary unto ours, nor afford us
any light to detenebrate and clear this Truth.</p>

<p>As for holy Scripture and divine revelation, there may also seem therein
but slender information, there being only left a brief narration hereof
by <i>Moses</i>, and such as affords no positive determination. For the Text
delivereth but two genealogies, that is, of <i>Cain</i> and <i>Seth</i>; in the
line of <i>Seth</i> there are only ten descents, in that of <i>Cain</i> but seven,
and those in a right line with mention of father and son; excepting that
of <i>Lamech</i>, where is also mention of wives, sons, and a daughter.
Notwithstanding if we seriously consider what is delivered therein, and
what is also deducible, it will be probably declared what is by us
intended, that is, the populous and ample habitation of the earth before
the flood. Which we shall labour to induce not from postulates and
entreated Maxims, but undeniable Principles declared in holy Scripture;
that is, the length of mens lives before the flood, and the large extent
of time from Creation thereunto.</p>

<p>We shall only first crave notice, that although in the relation of
<i>Moses</i> there be very few persons mentioned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span> yet are there many more to
be presumed; nor when the Scripture in the line of <i>Seth</i> nominates but
ten persons, are they to be conceived all that were of this generation:
The Scripture singly delivering the holy line, wherein the world was to
be preserved, first in <i>Noah</i>, and afterward in our Saviour. For in this
line it is manifest there were many more born than are named, for it is
said of them all, that they begat sons and daughters. And whereas it is
very late before it is said they begat those persons which are named in
the Scripture, the soonest at 65, it must not be understood that they
had none before; but not any in whom it pleased God the holy line should
be continued. And although the expression that they begat sons and
daughters be not determined to be before or after the mention of these,
yet must it be before in some; for before it is said that <i>Adam</i> begat
<i>Seth</i> at the 130 year, it is plainly affirmed that <i>Cain</i> knew his
wife, and had a son; which must be one of the daughters of <i>Adam</i>, one
of those whereof it is after said, he begat sons and daughters. And so
for ought can be disproved there might be more persons upon earth then
are commonly supposed, when <i>Cain</i> slew <i>Abel</i>; nor the fact so
hainously to be aggravated in the circumstance of the fourth person
living. And whereas it is said upon the nativity of <i>Seth</i>, God hath
appointed me another seed instead of <i>Abel</i>, it doth not imply he had no
other all this while; but not any of that expectation, or appointed (as
his name applies) to make a progression in the holy line; in whom the
world was to be saved, and from whom he should be born, that was
mystically slain in <i>Abel</i>.</p>

<p>Now our first ground to induce the numerosity of people before the
flood, is the long duration of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span> lives, beyond 7, 8, and 9, hundred
years. Which how it conduceth unto populosity we shall make but little
doubt, if we consider there are two main causes of numerosity in any
kind or species, that is, a frequent and multiparous way of breeding,
whereby they fill the world with others, though they exist not long
themselves; or a long duration and subsistence, whereby they do not only
replenish the world with a new annumeration of others, but also maintain
the former account in themselves. From the first cause we may observe
examples in creatures oviparous, as Birds and Fishes; in vermiparous, as
Flies, Locusts, and Gnats; in animals also viviparous, as Swine and
Conies. Of the first there is a great example in the herd of Swine in
<i>Galilee</i>; although an unclean beast, and forbidden unto the <i>Jews</i>. Of
the other a remarkable one in <i>Athenus</i>, in the Isle <i>Astipalea</i>, one of
the Cyclades now called <i>Stampalia</i>, wherein from two that were
imported, the number so increased, that the Inhabitants were constrained
to have recourse unto the Oracle <i>Delphos</i>, for an invention how to
destroy them.</p>

<p>Others there are which make good the paucity of their breed with the
length and duration of their daies, whereof there want not examples in
animals uniparous:<span class="sidenote"><i>A Million of Beeves yearly killed in England.</i></span>
First, in bisulcous or cloven-hooft, as Camels, and Beeves, whereof
there is above a million annually slain in <i>England</i>. It is also said of
<i>Job</i>, that he had a thousand yoak of Oxen, and six thousand Camels; and
of the children of <i>Israel</i> passing into the land of <i>Canaan</i>, that they
took from the <i>Midianites</i> threescore and ten thousand Beeves; and of
the Army of <i>Semiramis</i>, that there were therein one hundred thousand
Camels. For Solipeds or firm-hoofed animals, as Horses, Asses, Mules,
etc., they are also in mighty numbers, so it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span> delivered that <i>Job</i>
had a thousand she Asses: that the <i>Midianites</i> lost sixty one thousand
Asses. For Horses it is affirmed by <i>Diodorus</i>, that <i>Ninus</i> brought
against the <i>Bactrians</i> two hundred eighty thousand Horses; after him
<i>Semiramis</i> five hundred thousand Horses, and Chariots one hundred
thousand. Even in creatures steril and such as do not generate, the
length of life conduceth much unto the multiplicity of the species; for
the number of Mules which live far longer then their Dams or Sires, in
Countries where they are bred, is very remarkable, and far more common
then Horses.</p>

<p>For Animals multifidous, or such as are digitated or have several
divisions in their feet, there are but two that are uniparous, that is,
Men and Elephants; who though their productions be but single, are
notwithstanding very numerous. The Elephant (as <i>Aristotle</i> affirmeth)
carrieth the young two years, and conceiveth not again (as <i>Edvardus
Lopez</i> affirmeth) in many after, yet doth their age requite this
disadvantage; they living commonly one hundred, sometime two hundred
years. Now although they be rare with us in <i>Europe</i>, and altogether
unknown unto <i>America</i>, yet in the two other parts of the world they are
in great abundance, as appears by the relation of <i>Gorcias ab Horto</i>,
Physitian to the Viceroy at <i>Goa</i>, who relates that at one venation the
King of <i>Sion</i> took four thousand; and is of opinion they are in other
parts in greater number then herds of Beeves in <i>Europe</i>. And though
this delivered from a <i>Spaniard</i> unacquainted with our Northern droves,
may seem very far to exceed; yet must we conceive them very numerous, if
we consider the number of teeth transported from one Country to another;
they having only two great teeth, and those not falling or renewing.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>As for man, the disadvantage in his single issue is the same with these,
and in the lateness of his generation somewhat greater then any; yet in
the continual and not interrupted time thereof, and the extent of his
days, he becomes at present, if not then any other species, at least
more numerous then these before mentioned. Now being thus numerous at
present, and in the measure of threescore, fourscore or an hundred
years, if their dayes extended unto six, seven, or eight hundred, their
generations would be proportionably multiplied; their times of
generation being not only multiplied, but their subsistence continued.
For though the great Grand-child went on, the <i>Petrucius</i><span class="sidenote"><i>The term
for that person from whom consanguineal relations are accounted, as in
the</i> Arbor civilis.</span> and first Original would subsist and make one of
the world; though he outlived all the terms of consanguinity, and became
a stranger unto his proper progeny. So by compute of Scripture <i>Adam</i>
lived unto the ninth generation, unto the days of <i>Lamech</i> the Father of
<i>Noah</i>; <i>Methuselah</i> unto the year of the flood; and <i>Noah</i> was
contemporary unto all from <i>Enoch</i> unto <i>Abraham</i>. So that although some
died, the father beholding so many descents, the number of Survivers
must still be very great; for if half the men were now alive, which
lived in the last Century, the earth would scarce contain their number.
Whereas in our abridged and Septuagesimal Ages, it is very rare, and
deserves a Distick<span class="sidenote">Mater ait nat√¶ dic nat√¶ filia, etc.</span> to behold
the fourth generation. <i>Xerxes</i> complaint still remaining; and what he
lamented in his Army, being almost deplorable in the whole world: men
seldom arriving unto those years whereby <i>Methuselah</i> exceeded nine
hundred, and what <i>Adam</i> came short of a thousand, was defined long ago
to be the age of man.</p>

<p>Now although the length of days conduceth mainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span> unto the numerosity of
mankind, and it be manifest from Scripture they lived very long, yet is
not the period of their lives determinable, and some might be longer
livers, than we account that any were. For (to omit that conceit of
some, that <i>Adam</i> was the oldest man, in as much as he is conceived to
be created in the maturity of mankind, that is, at 60, (for in that age
it is set down they begat children) so that adding this number unto his
930, he was 21 years older than any of his posterity) that even
<i>Methuselah</i> was the longest liver of all the children of <i>Adam</i>, we
need not grant; nor is it definitively set down by <i>Moses</i>. Indeed of
those ten mentioned in Scripture, with their severall ages it must be
true; but whether those seven of the line of <i>Cain</i> and their progeny,
or any of the sons or daughters posterity after them out-lived those, is
not expressed in holy Scripture; and it will seem more probable, that of
the line of <i>Cain</i> some were longer lived than any of <i>Seth</i>; if we
concede that seven generations of the one lived as long as nine of the
other. As for what is commonly alledged, that God would not permit the
life of any unto a thousand, because (alluding unto that of <i>David</i>) no
man should live one day in the sight of the Lord; although it be urged
by divers, yet is it methinks an inference somewhat Rabbinicall; and not
of power to perswade a serious examinator.</p>

<p>Having thus declared how powerfully the length of lives conduced unto
populosity of those times, it will yet be easier acknowledged if we
descend to particularities, and consider how many in seven hundred years
might descend from one man; wherein considering the length of their
dayes, we may conceive the greatest number to have been alive together.
And this that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span> no reasonable spirit may contradict, we will declare with
manifest disadvantage; for whereas the duration of the world unto the
flood was above 1600 years, we will make our compute in less then half
that time. Nor will we begin with the first man, but allow the earth to
be provided of women fit for marriage the second or third first
Centuries; and will only take as granted, that they might beget children
at sixty, and at an hundred years have twenty, allowing for that number
forty years. Nor will we herein single out <i>Methuselah</i>, or account from
the longest livers, but make choice of the shortest of any we find
recorded in the Text, excepting <i>Enoch</i>; who after he had lived as many
years as there be days in the year, was translated at 365. And thus from
one stock of seven hundred years, multiplying still by twenty, we shall
find the product to be one thousand, three hundred forty seven millions,
three hundred sixty eight thousand, four hundred and twenty.</p>

<p>Now if this account of the learned <i>Petavius</i> will be allowed, it will
make an unexpected encrease, and a larger number than may be found in
<i>Asia</i>, <i>Africa</i> and <i>Europe</i>; especially if in <i>Constantinople</i>, the
greatest City thereof, there be no more of Europe than <i>Botero</i>
accounteth, seven hundred thousand souls. Which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span> duly considered, we
shall rather admire how the earth contained its inhabitants, then doubt
its inhabitation; and might conceive the deluge not simply penall, but
in some way also necessary, as many have conceived of translations, if
<i>Adam</i> had not sinned, and the race of man had remained upon earth
immortal.</p>

<p>Now whereas some to make good their longevity, have imagined that the
years of their compute were Lunary; unto these we must reply: That if by
a Lunary year they understand twelve revolutions of the Moon, that is
354 days, eleven fewer then in the Solary year; there will be no great
difference; at least not sufficient to convince or extenuate the
question. But if by a Lunary year they mean one revolution of the Moon,
that is, a moneth, they first introduce a year never used by the Hebrews
in their Civil accompts; and what is delivered before of the Chaldean
years (as <i>Xenophon</i> gives a caution) was only received in the
Chronology of their Arts. Secondly, they contradict the Scripture, which
makes a plain enumeration of many moneths in the account of the Deluge;
for so is it expressed in the Text. In the tenth moneth, in the first
day of the moneth were the tops of the mountains seen: Concordant
whereunto is the relation of humane Authors, <i>Inundationes plures fuere,
prima novimestris inundatio terrarum sub prisco Ogyge. <span class="sidenote">Xenophon de
√Üquivocis.</span> Meminisse hoc loco par est post primum diluvium Ogygi
temporibus notatum, cum novem et amplius mensibus diem continua nox
inumbrasset, Delon ante omnes terras radiis solis illuminatum
sortitumque ex eo nomen.</i> <span class="sidenote10">Solinus.</span> And lastly, they fall upon an
absurdity, for they make <i>Enoch</i> to beget children about six years of
age. For whereas it is said he begat <i>Methuselah</i> at 65, if we shall
account every moneth a year, he was at that time some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span> six years and an
half, for so many moneths are contained in that space of time.</p>

<p>Having thus declared how much the length of mens lives conduced unto the
populosity of their kind, our second foundation must be the large extent
of time, from the Creation unto the Deluge, that is (according unto
received computes about 1655 years) almost as long a time as hath passed
since the nativity of our Saviour: and this we cannot but conceive
sufficient for a very large increase, if we do but affirm what
reasonable enquirers will not deny: That the earth might be as populous
in that number of years before the flood, as we can manifest it was in
the same number after. And whereas there may be conceived some
disadvantage, in regard that at the Creation the original of mankind was
in two persons, but after the flood their propagation issued at least
from six; against this we might very well set the length of their lives
before the flood, which were abbreviated after, and in half this space
contracted into hundreds and threescores. Notwithstanding to equalize
accounts, we will allow three hundred years, and so long a time as we
can manifest from the Scripture. There were four men at least that begat
children, <i>Adam</i>, <i>Cain</i>, <i>Seth</i>, and <i>Enos</i>; So shall we fairly and
favourably proceed, if we affirm the world to have been as populous in
sixteen hundred and fifty before the flood, as it was in thirteen
hundred after. Now how populous and largely inhabited it was within this
period of time, we shall declare from probabilities, and several
testimonies of Scripture and humane Authors.</p>

<p>And first, To manifest the same neer those parts of the earth where the
Ark is presumed to have rested, we have the relation of holy Scripture
accounting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span> genealogy of <i>Japhet</i>, <i>Cham</i> and <i>Sem</i>, and in this
last, four descents unto the division of the earth in the days of
<i>Peleg</i>, which time although it were not upon common compute much above
an hundred years, yet were men at this time mightily increased. Nor can
we well conceive it otherwise, if we consider they began already to
wander from their first habitation, and were able to attempt so mighty a
work as the building of a City and a Tower, whose top should reach unto
the heavens. Whereunto there was required no slender number of persons,
if we consider the magnitude thereof, expressed by some, and conceived
to be <i>Turris Beli</i> in <i>Herodotus</i>; and the multitudes of people
recorded at the erecting of the like or inferiour structures: for at the
building of <i>Solomons</i> Temple there were threescore and ten thousand
that carried burdens, and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains,
beside the chief of his officers three thousand and three hundred; and
at the erecting of the Piramids in the reign of King <i>Cheops</i>, as
<i>Herodotus</i> reports, there were <i>decem myriads</i>, that is an hundred
thousand <i>men</i>. And though it be said of the <i>Egyptians</i>, <i>Porrum et
c√¶pe nefas violare et frangere morsu</i>;<span class="sidenote10">Juvenal.</span> yet did the summes
expended in Garlick and Onyons amount unto no less then one thousand six
hundred Talents.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Who</i> Nimrod <i>and</i> Assur <i>were.</i></div>

<p>The first Monarchy or Kingdom of <i>Babylon</i> is mentioned in Scripture
under the foundation of <i>Nimrod</i>, which is also recorded in humane
history; as beside <i>Berosus</i>, in <i>Diodorus</i> and <i>Justine</i>, for <i>Nimrod</i>
of the Scriptures is <i>Belus</i> of the Gentiles, and <i>Assur</i> the same with
<i>Ninus</i> his successour. There is also mention of divers Cities,
particularly of <i>Ninivey</i> and <i>Resen</i> expressed emphatically in the Text
to be a great City.</p>

<p>That other Countries round about were also peopled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span> appears by the Wars
of the Monarchs of <i>Assyria</i> with the <i>Bactrians</i>, <i>Indians</i>,
<i>Scythians</i>, <i>Ethiopians</i>, <i>Armenians</i>, <i>Hyrcanians</i>, <i>Parthians</i>,
<i>Persians</i>, <i>Susians</i>; they vanquishing (as <i>Diodorus</i> relateth)
<i>Egypt</i>, <i>Syria</i>, and all <i>Asia</i> minor, even from <i>Bosphorus</i> unto
<i>Tanais</i>. And it is said, that <i>Semiramis</i> in her expedition against the
<i>Indians</i> brought along with her the King of <i>Arabia</i>. About the same
time of the <i>Assyrian</i> Monarchy, do Authors place that of the
<i>Sycionians</i> in <i>Greece</i>, and soon after that of the <i>Argives</i>, and not
very long after, that of the <i>Athenians</i> under <i>Cecrops</i>; and within our
period assumed are historified many memorable actions of the Greeks, as
the expedition of the <i>Argonautes</i>, with the most famous Wars of
<i>Thebes</i> and <i>Troy</i>.</p>

<p>That <i>Canaan</i> also and <i>Egypt</i> were well peopled far within this period,
besides their plantation by <i>Canaan</i> and <i>Misraim</i>, appeareth from the
history of <i>Abraham</i>, who in less then 400 years after the Flood,
journied from <i>Mesopotamia</i> unto <i>Canaan</i> and <i>Egypt</i>, both which he
found well peopled and policied into Kingdoms: wherein also in 430
years, from threescore and ten persons which came with <i>Jacob</i> into
<i>Egypt</i>, he became a mighty Nation; for it is said, at their departure,
there journeyed from <i>Rhamesis</i> to <i>Succoth</i> about six hundred thousand
on foot, that were men, besides children. Now how populous the land from
whence they came was, may be collected not only from their ability in
commanding such subjections and mighty powers under them, but from the
several accounts of that Kingdom delivered by <i>Herodotus</i>. And how soon
it was peopled, is evidenced from the pillar of their King <i>Osyris</i>,
with this inscription in <i>Diodorus</i>; <i>Mihi pater est Saturnus deorum
junior, sum vero Osyris rex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span> qui totum peragravi orbem usq; ad Indorum
fines, ad eos quoq; sum profectus qui septentrioni subjacent usq; ad
Istri fontes, et alias partes usq; ad Occanum.</i> <span class="sidenote"><i>Who</i> Osyris <i>and</i>
Saturnus √Ügyptius <i>were</i>.</span> Now according unto the best determinations
<i>Osyris</i> was <i>Misraim</i>, and <i>Saturnus Egyptius</i> the same with <i>Cham</i>;
after whose name <i>Egypt</i> is not only called in Scripture the laud of
<i>Ham</i>, but thus much is also testified by <i>Plutarch</i>; for in his
Treatise <i>de Osyride</i>, he delivereth that <i>Egypt</i> was called <i>Chamia a
Chamo Noe filio</i>, that is from <i>Cham</i> the son of <i>Noah</i>. And if
according to the consent of ancient Fathers, <i>Adam</i> was buried in the
same place where Christ was crucified, that is Mount <i>Calvary</i>, the
first man ranged far before the Flood, and laid his bones many miles
from that place, where its presumed he received them. And this migration
was the greater, if as the text expresseth, he was cast out of the
East-side of Paradise to till the ground; and as the Position of the
Cherubines implieth, who were placed at the east end of the garden to
keep him from the tree of life.</p>

<p>That the remoter parts of the earth were in this time inhabited is also
induceable from the like testimonies; for (omitting the numeration of
<i>Josephus</i>, and the genealogies of the Sons of <i>Noah</i>) that <i>Italy</i> was
inhabited, appeareth from the Records of <i>Livie</i>, and <i>Dionysius
Halicarnasscus</i>, the story of <i>√Üneas</i>, <i>Evander</i> and <i>Janus</i>, whom
<i>Annius</i> of <i>Viterbo</i>, and the Chorographers of <i>Italy</i>, do make to be
the same with <i>Noah</i>. That <i>Sicily</i> was also peopled, is made out from
the frequent mention thereof in <i>Homer</i>, the Records of <i>Diodorus</i> and
others; but especially from a remarkable passage touched by <i>Aretius</i>
and <i>Ranzanus</i> Bishop of <i>Lucerium</i>, but fully explained by <i>Thomas
Fazelli</i> in his accurate History of <i>Sicily</i>; that is, from an ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
inscription in a stone at <i>Panormo</i>, expressed by him in its proper
characters, and by a <i>Syrian</i> thus translated, <i>Non est alius Deus
pr√¶ter unum Deum, non est alius potens pr√¶ter eundem Deum, neq; est
alius victor pr√¶ter eundem quem colimus Deum: Hujus turris pr√¶fectus
est</i> Sapha <i>filius</i> Eliphat, <i>filii</i> Esau, <i>fratris</i> Jacob, <i>filii</i>
Isaac, <i>filii</i> Abraham: <i>et turri quidem ipsi nomen est</i> Baych, <i>sed
turri huic proxim√¶ nomen est</i> Pharath. The antiquity of the inhabitation
of <i>Spain</i> is also confirmable, not only from <i>Berosus</i> in the
plantation of <i>Tubal</i>, and a City continuing yet in his name, but the
story of <i>Gerion</i>, the travels of <i>Hercules</i> and his pillars: and
especially a passage in <i>Strabo</i>, which advanceth unto the time of
<i>Ninus</i>, thus delivered in his fourth book. The <i>Spaniards</i> (saith he)
affirm that they have had Laws and Letters above six thousand years. Now
the <i>Spaniards</i> or <i>Iberians</i> observing (as <i>Xenophon</i> hath delivered)
<i>Annum quadrimestrem</i>, four moneths unto a year, this compute will make
up 2000 solary years, which is about the space of time from <i>Strabo</i>,
who lived in the days of <i>Augustus</i>, unto the reign of <i>Ninus</i>.</p>

<p>That <i>Mauritania</i> and the coast of <i>Africa</i> were peopled very soon, is
the conjecture of many wise men, and that by the <i>Ph≈ìnicians</i>, who
left their Country upon the invasion of <i>Canaan</i> by the <i>Israelites</i>.
For beside the conformity of the <i>Punick</i> or <i>Carthaginian</i> language
with that of <i>Ph≈ìnicia</i>, there is a pregnant and very remarkable
testimony hereof in <i>Procopius</i>, who in his second <i>de bello Vandalico</i>,
recordeth, that in a town of <i>Mauritania Tingitana</i>, there was to be
seen upon two white Columns in the <i>Ph≈ìnician</i> language these ensuing
words; <i>Nos Maurici sumus qui fugimus a facie Jehoschua filii Nunis
pr√¶datoris</i>. The fortunate Islands or <i>Canaries</i> were not unknown; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
so doth <i>Strabo</i> interpret that speech in <i>Homer</i> of <i>Proteus</i> unto
<i>Menelaus</i>,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="line"><i>Sed te qua terr√¶ postremus terminus extat,</i></div>
<div class="line"><i>Elysium in Campum c≈ìlestia numina ducunt.</i></div>
</div></div>

<p>The like might we affirm from credible histories both of <i>France</i> and
<i>Germany</i>, and perhaps also of our own Country. For omitting the
fabulous and <i>Trojan</i> original delivered by <i>Jeofrey</i> of <i>Monmouth</i>, and
the express text of Scripture; that the race of <i>Japhet</i> did people the
Isles of the <i>Gentiles</i>; the <i>Brittish</i> Original was so obscure in
<i>C√¶sars</i> time, that he affirmeth the Inland inhabitants were
<i>Aborigines</i>, that is, such as reported that they had their beginning in
the Island. That <i>Ireland</i> our neighbour Island was not long time
without Inhabitants, may be made probable by sundry accounts; although
we abate the Traditions of <i>Bartholanus</i> the <i>Scythian</i>, who arrived
there three hundred years after the flood, or the relation of
<i>Giraldus</i>; that <i>C√¶saria</i> the daughter of <i>Noah</i> dwelt there before.</p>

<p>Now should we call in the learned account of <i>Bochartus</i>,<span class="sidenote">Bochart.
Geog. <i>Sacr. part. 2.</i></span> deducing the ancient names of Countries from
<i>Ph≈ìnicians</i>, who by their plantations, discoveries, and sea
negotiations, have left unto very many Countries, <i>Ph≈ìnician</i>
denominations; the enquiry would be much shorter, and if <i>Spain</i> in the
<i>Ph≈ìnician</i> Original, be but the region of <i>Conies</i>, <i>Lusitania</i>, or
<i>Portugal</i> the Countrey of Almonds, if <i>Brittanica</i> were at first
<i>Baratanaca</i>, or the land of Tin, and <i>Ibernia</i> or <i>Ireland</i>, were but
<i>Ibernae</i>, or the farthest habitation; and these names imposed and
dispersed by <i>Ph≈ìnician</i> Colonies in their several navigations; the
Antiquity of habitations might be more clearly advanced.</p>

<p>Thus though we have declared how largely the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span> world was inhabited within
the space of 1300 years, yet must it be conceived more populous then can
be clearly evinced; for a greater part of the earth hath ever been
peopled, then hath been known or described by Geographers, as will
appear by the discoveries of all Ages. For neither in <i>Herodotus</i> or
<i>Thucydides</i> do we find any mention of <i>Rome</i>, nor in <i>Ptolomy</i> of many
parts of <i>Europe</i>, <i>Asia</i> or <i>Africa</i>. And because many places we have
declared of long plantations of whose populosity notwithstanding or
memorable actions we have no ancient story; if we may conjecture of
these by what we find related of others, we shall not need many words,
nor assume the half of 1300 years. And this we might illustrate from the
mighty acts of the <i>Assyrians</i> performed not long after the flood;
recorded by <i>Justine</i> and <i>Diodorus</i>; who makes relation of expeditions
by Armies more numerous then have been ever since. For <i>Ninus</i> King of
<i>Assyria</i> brought against the <i>Bactrians</i> 700000 foot, 200000 horse,
10600 Chariots. <i>Semiramis</i> his successor led against the <i>Indians</i>
1300000 foot, 500000 horse, 100000 Chariots, and as many upon Camels:
And it is said, <i>Staurobates</i> the <i>Indian</i> King, met her with greater
forces then she brought against him. All which was performed within less
then four hundred years after the flood.</p>

<p>Now if any imagine the unity of their language did hinder their
dispersion before the flood, we confess it some hindrance at first, but
not much afterward. For though it might restrain their dispersion, it
could not their populosity; which necessarily requireth transmigration
and emission of Colonies; as we read of <i>Romans</i>, <i>Greeks</i>,
<i>Ph≈ìnicians</i> in ages past, and have beheld examples thereof in our
days. We may also observe that after the flood before the confusion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
tongues, men began to disperse: for it is said, they journeyed towards
the East: and the Scripture it self expresseth a necessity conceived of
their dispersion, for the intent of erecting the Tower is so delivered
in the text, Lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the earth.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Whether any Islands before the Flood.</i></div>

<p>Again, If any apprehend the plantation of the earth more easie in regard
of Navigation and shipping discovered since the flood, whereby the
Islands and divided parts of the earth are now inhabited; he must
consider, that whether there were Islands or no before the flood, is not
yet determined, and is with probability denied by very learned Authors.</p>

<p>Lastly, If we shall fall into apprehension that it was less inhabited,
because it is said in the sixt of <i>Genesis</i> about a 120 years before the
flood, and it came to pass that when men began to multiply upon the face
of the earth. Beside that this may be only meant of the race of <i>Cain</i>,
it will not import they were not multiplied before, but that they were
at that time plentifully encreased; for so is the same word used in
other parts of Scripture. And so is it afterward in the 9 Chapter said,
that <i>Noah</i> began to be an husbandman, that is, he was so, or earnestly
performed the Acts thereof; so it is said of our Saviour, that he began
to cast them out that bought and sold in the Temple, that is, he
actually cast them out, or with alacrity effected it.</p>

<p>Thus have I declared some private and probable conceptions in the
enquiry of this truth; but the certainty hereof let the Arithmetick of
the last day determine; and therefore expect no further belief than
probability and reason induce. Only desire men would not swallow
dubiosities for certainties, and receive as Principles points mainly
controvertible; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span> we are to adhere unto things doubtful in a dubious
and opinative way. It being reasonable for every man to vary his opinion
according to the variance of his reason, and to affirm one day what he
denied another. Wherein although at last we miss of truth; we die
notwithstanding in harmless and inoffensive errors; because we adhere
unto that, whereunto the examen of our reasons, and honest enquiries
induce us.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII_PE_VI" id="CHAPTER_VII_PE_VI">CHAPTER VII</a>
<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of East, and West.</span></h2>


<p>The next shall be of East and West; that is, the proprieties and
conditions ascribed unto Regions respectively unto those situations;
which hath been the obvious conception of Philosophers and Geographers,
magnifying the condition of <i>India</i>, and the Eastern Countries, above
the setting and occidental Climates, some ascribing hereto the
generation of gold, precious stones and spices, others the civility and
natural endowments of men; conceiving the bodies of this situation to
receive a special impression from the first salutes of the Sun, and some
appropriate influence from his ascendent and oriental radiations. But
these proprieties affixed unto bodies, upon considerations deduced from
East, West, or those observable points of the sphere, how specious and
plausible so ever, will not upon enquiry be justified from such
foundations.</p>

<p>For to speak strictly, there is no East and West in nature, nor are
those absolute and invariable, but respective and mutable points,
according unto different longitudes, or distant parts of habitation,
whereby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span> they suffer many and considerable variations. For first, unto
some the same part will be East or West in respect of one another, that
is, unto such as inhabit the same parallel, or differently dwell from
East to West. Thus as unto <i>Spain</i>, <i>Italy</i> lyeth East, unto <i>Italy</i>
<i>Greece</i>, unto <i>Greece</i> <i>Persia</i>, and unto <i>Persia</i> <i>China</i>; so again
unto the Country of <i>China</i>, <i>Persia</i> lyeth West, unto <i>Persia</i>
<i>Greece</i>, unto <i>Greece</i> <i>Italy</i>, and unto <i>Italy</i> <i>Spain</i>. So that the
same Countrey is sometimes East and sometimes West; and <i>Persia</i> though
East unto <i>Greece</i>, yet is it West unto <i>China</i>.</p>

<p>Unto other habitations the same point will be both East and West; as
unto those that are <i>Antipodes</i> or seated in points of the Globe
diametrically opposed. So the <i>Americans</i> are Antipodal unto the
<i>Indians</i>, and some part of <i>India</i> is both East and West unto
<i>America</i>, according as it shall be regarded from one side or the other,
to the right or to the left; and setting out from any middle point,
either by East or West, the distance unto the place intended is equal,
and in the same space of time in nature also performable.</p>

<p>To a third that have the Poles for their vertex, or dwell in the
position of a parallel sphere, there will be neither East nor West, at
least the greatest part of the year. For if (as the name <i>Oriental</i>
implyeth) they shall account that part to be East where ever the Sun
ariseth, or that West where the Sun is occidental or setteth: almost
half the year they have neither the one nor the other. For half the year
it is below their Horizon, and the other half it is continually above
it, and circling round about them intersecting not the Horizon, nor
leaveth any part for this compute. And if (which will seem very
reasonable) that part should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span> termed the Eastern point, where the Sun
at √Üquinox, and but once in the year ariseth, yet will this also disturb
the cardinal accounts, nor will it with propriety admit that
appellation. For that surely cannot be accounted East which hath the
South on both sides; which notwithstanding this position must have. For
if unto such as live under the Pole, that he only North which is above
them, that must be Southerly which is below them, which is all the other
portion of the by Globe, beside that part possessed them. And thus these
points of East and West being not absolute in any, respective in some,
and not at all relating unto others; we cannot hereon establish so
general considerations, nor reasonably erect such immutable assertions,
upon so unstable foundations.</p>

<p>Now the ground that begat or promoted this conceit, was first a mistake
in the apprehension of East and West, considering thereof as of the
North and South, and computing by these as invariably as by the other;
but herein, upon second thoughts there is a great disparity. <span class="sidenote"><i>What
the Northern and Southern Poles be.</i></span> For the North and Southern Pole,
are the invariable terms of that Axis whereon the heavens do move; and
are therefore incommunicable and fixed points; wherof the one is not
apprehensible in the other. But with East and West it is quite
otherwise: for the revolution of the Orbs being made upon the Poles of
North and South, all other points about the Axis are mutable; and
wheresoever therein the East point be determined, by succession of parts
in one revolution every point becometh East. And so if where the Sun
ariseth, that part be termed East, every habitation differing in
longitude, will have this point also different; in as much as the Sun
successively ariseth unto every one.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<p>The second ground, although it depend upon the former, approacheth
nearer the effect; and that is the efficacy of the Sun, set out and
divided according to priority of ascent; whereby his influence is
conceived more favourable unto one Countrey than another, and to
felicitate <i>India</i> more than any after. But hereby we cannot avoid
absurdities, and such as infer effects controulable by our senses. For
first, by the same reason that we affirm the <i>Indian</i> richer than the
<i>American</i>, the <i>American</i> will also be more plentiful than the
<i>Indian</i>, and <i>England</i> or <i>Spain</i> more fruitful than <i>Hispaniola</i> or
golden Castle: in as much as the Sun ariseth unto the one sooner than
the other: and so accountably unto any Nation subjected unto the same
parallel, or with a considerable diversity of longitude from each other.</p>

<p>Secondly, An unsufferable absurdity will ensue: for thereby a Country
may be more fruitful than it self: For <i>India</i> is more fertile than
<i>Spain</i>, because more East, and that the Sun ariseth first unto it:
<i>Spain</i>, likewise by the same reason more fruitful than <i>America</i>, and
<i>America</i> than <i>India</i>: so that <i>Spain</i> is less fruitful than that
Countrey, which a less fertile Country than it self excelleth.</p>

<p>Lastly, If we conceive the Sun hath any advantage by priority of ascent,
or makes thereby one Country more happy than another, we introduce
injustifiable determinations, and impose a natural partiality on that
Luminary, which being equidistant from the earth, and equally removed in
the East as in the West, his Power and Efficacy in both places must be
equal, as <i>Boetius</i> hath taken notice, and <i>Scaliger</i><span class="sidenote">De gemmis
exercitat.</span> hath graphically declared. Some have therefore forsaken this
refuge of the Sun, and to salve the effect have recurred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span> unto the
influence of the Stars, making their activities National, and
appropriating their Powers unto particular regions. So <i>Cardan</i>
conceiveth the tail of <i>Ursa Major</i> peculiarly respecteth <i>Europe</i>:
whereas indeed once in 24 hours it also absolveth its course over <i>Asia</i>
and <i>America</i>. And therefore it will not be easie to apprehend those
stars peculiarly glance on us, who must of necessity carry a common eye
and regard unto all Countries, unto whom their revolution and verticity
is also common.</p>

<p>The effects therefore or different productions in several Countries,
which we impute unto the action of the Sun, must surely have nearer and
more immediate causes than that Luminary. And these if we place in the
propriety of clime, or condition of soil wherein they are produced, we
shall more reasonably proceed, than they who ascribe them unto the
activity of the Sun. Whose revolution being regular, it hath no power
nor efficacy peculiar from its orientality, but equally disperseth his
beams unto all, which equally, and in the same restriction, receive his
lustre. And being an universal and indefinite agent, the effects or
productions we behold, receive not their circle from his causality, but
are determined by the principles of the place, or qualities of that
region which admits them. And this is evident not only in gemms,
minerals, and mettals, but observable in plants and animals; whereof
some are common unto many Countries, some peculiar unto one, some not
communicable unto another. <span class="sidenote"><i>Whence proceed the different
commodities of several Countries.</i></span> For the hand of God that first
created the earth, hath with variety disposed the principles of all
things; wisely contriving them in their proper seminaries, and where
they best maintain the intention of their species; whereof if they have
not a concurrence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span> and be not lodged in a convenient matrix, they are
not excited by the efficacy of the Sun; or failing in particular causes,
receive a relief or sufficient promotion from the universal. For
although superiour powers co-operate with inferiour activities, and may
(as some conceive) carry a stroke in the plastick and formative draught
of all things, yet do their determinations belong unto particular
agents, and are defined from their proper principles. Thus the Sun which
with us is fruitful in the generation of Frogs, Toads and Serpents, to
this effect proves impotent in our neighbour Island; wherein as in all
other carrying a common aspect, it concurreth but unto predisposed
effects; and only suscitates those forms, whose determinations are
seminal, and proceed from the <i>Idea</i> of themselves.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Why Astrological judgments upon Nativities be taken from the
Ascendent.</i></div>

<p>Now whereas there be many observations concerning East, and divers
considerations of Art which seem to extol the quality of that point, if
rightly understood they do not really promote it. That the Astrologer
takes account of nativities from the Ascendent, that is, the first house
of the heavens, whose beginning is toward the East, it doth not
advantage the conceit. For, he establisheth not his Judgment upon the
orientality thereof, but considereth therein his first ascent above the
Horizon; at which time its efficacy becomes observable, and is conceived
to have the signification of life, and to respect the condition of all
things, which at the same time arise from their causes, and ascend to
their Horizon with it. Now this ascension indeed falls out respectively
in the East: but as we have delivered before, in some positions there is
no Eastern point from whence to compute these ascentions. So is it in a
parallel sphere: for unto them six houses are continually depressed, and
six never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span> elevated: and the planets themselves, whose revolutions are
of more speed, and influences of higher consideration, must find in that
place a very imperfect regard; for half their period they absolve above,
and half beneath the Horizon. And so for six years, no man can have the
happiness to be born under <i>Jupiter</i>: and for fifteen together all must
escape the ascendent dominion of <i>Saturn</i>.</p>

<p>That <i>Aristotle</i> in his Politicks, commends the situation of a City
which is open towards the East, and admitteth the raies of the rising
Sun, thereby is implied no more particular efficacy than in the West:
But that position is commended, in regard the damps and vaporous
exhalations ingendered in the absence of the Sun, are by his returning
raies the sooner dispelled; and men thereby more early enjoy a clear and
healthy habitation. Upon the like considerations it is, that <i>Marcus
Varro</i><span class="sidenote15">De re Rustica.</span> commendeth the same situation, and exposeth
his farm unto the equinoxial ascent of the Sun, and that <i>Palladius</i>
adviseth the front of his edifice should so respect the South, that in
the first angle it receive the rising raies of the Winter Sun, and
decline a little from the Winter setting thereof. And concordant
hereunto is the instruction of <i>Columella De positione vill√¶</i>: which he
contriveth into Summer and Winter habitations, ordering that the Winter
lodgings regard the Winter ascent of the Sun, that is South-East; and
the rooms of repast at supper, the √Üquinoxial setting thereof, that is
the West: that the Summer lodgings regard the √Üquinoxial Meridian: but
the rooms of c√¶nation in the Summer, he obverts unto the Winter ascent,
that is, South-East; and the Balnearies or bathing places, that they may
remain under the Sun until evening, he exposeth unto the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span> Summer
setting, that is, North-West, in all which although the Cardinal points
be introduced, yet is the consideration Solary, and only determined unto
the aspect or visible reception of the Sun.</p>

<p><i>Jews</i> and <i>Mahometans</i> in these and our neighbour parts are observed to
use some gestures towards the East, as at their benediction, and the
killing of their meat. And though many ignorant spectators, and not a
few of the Actors conceive some Magick or Mysterie therein, yet is the
Ceremony only Topical, and in a memorial relation unto a place they
honour. So the <i>Jews</i> do carry a respect and cast an eye upon
<i>Jerusalem</i>: for which practice they are not without the example of
their fore-fathers, and the encouragement of their wise King; For so it
is said that <i>Daniel</i><span class="sidenote10"><i>Dan.</i> 6.</span> went into his house, and his
windows being opened towards <i>Jerusalem</i>, he kneeled upon his knees
three times a day, and prayed. So is it expressed in the prayer of
<i>Solomon</i>, what prayer or supplication soever be made by any man, which
shall spread forth his hands towards this house: if thy people go out to
battle, and shall pray unto the Lord towards the City which thou hast
chosen, and towards the house which I have chosen to build for thy Name,
then hear thou in heaven their prayer and their supplication, and
maintain their cause. Now the observation hereof, unto the Jews that are
dispersed Westward, and such as most converse with us, directeth their
regard unto the East: But the words of <i>Solomon</i> are appliable unto all
quarters of Heaven: and by the Jews of the East and South must be
regarded in a contrary position. So <i>Daniel</i> in <i>Babylon</i> looking toward
<i>Jerusalem</i> had his face toward the West. So the Jews in their own land
looked upon it from all quarters. For the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span> Tribe of <i>Judah</i> beheld it to
the North: <i>Manasses</i>, <i>Zabulon</i>, and <i>Napthali</i> unto the South:
<i>Reuben</i> and <i>Gad</i> unto the West; only the Tribe of <i>Dan</i> regarded it
directly or to the due East. So when it is said,<span class="sidenote"><i>Luke</i> 12.</span> when
you see a cloud rise out of the West, you say there cometh a shower, and
so it is: the observation was respective unto <i>Judea</i>: nor is this a
reasonable illation in all other Nations whatsoever: For the Sea lay
West unto that Country, and the winds brought rain from that quarter;
But this consideration cannot be transferred unto <i>India</i> or <i>China</i>,
which have a vast Sea Eastward, and a vaster Continent toward the West.
So likewise when it is said <span class="sidenote10"><i>Job.</i></span> in the vulgar Translation, Gold
cometh out of the North, it is no reasonable inducement unto us and many
other Countries, from some particular mines septentrional unto his
situation, to search after that mettal in cold and Northern regions,
which we most plentifully discover in hot and Southern habitations.</p>

<p>For the <i>Mahometans</i>, as they partake with all Religions in something,
so they imitate the <i>Jew</i> in this. For in their observed gestures, they
hold a regard unto <i>Mecha</i> and <i>Medina Talnabi</i>, two Cities in <i>Arabia
f√¶lix</i>, where their Prophet was born and buried; whither they perform
their pilgrimages: and from whence they expect he should return again.
And therefore they direct their faces unto these parts, which unto the
<i>Mahometans</i> of <i>Barbary</i> and <i>Egypt</i> lie East, and are in some point
thereof unto many other parts of <i>Turkie</i>. Wherein notwithstanding there
is no Oriental respect; for with the same devotion on the other side
they regard these parts toward the West, and so with variety wheresover
they are seated, conforming unto the ground of their conception.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>

<p>Fourthly, Whereas in the ordering of the Camp of <i>Israel</i>, the East
quarter is appointed unto the noblest Tribe, that is the Tribe of
<i>Judah</i>, according to the command of God,<span class="sidenote10"><i>Num. 3.</i></span> in the
East-side toward the rising of the Sun shall the Standard of the Tribe
of <i>Judah</i> pitch: it doth not peculiarly extol that point. For herein
the East is not to be taken strictly, but as it signifieth or implieth
the foremost place; for <i>Judah</i> had the Van, and many Countries through
which they passed were seated Easterly unto them. Thus much is implied
by the Original, and expressed by Translations which strictly conform
thereto: So <i>Tremelius</i>, <i>Castra habentium ab anteriore parte Orientem
versus, vexillum esto castrorum Jud√¶</i>; so hath <i>R. Solomon Jarchi</i>
expounded it, the foremost or before, is the East quarter, and the West
is called behind. And upon this interpretation may all be salved that is
alleageable against it. For if the Tribe of <i>Judah</i> were to pitch before
the Tabernacle at the East, and yet to march first, as is commanded,
<i>Numb.</i> 10. there must ensue a disorder in the Camp, nor could they
conveniently observe the execution thereof: For when they set out from
<i>Mount Sinah</i> where the Command was delivered, they made Northward unto
<i>Rithmah</i>; from <i>Rissah</i> unto <i>Eziongaber</i> about fourteen stations they
marched South: From <i>Almon Diblathaim</i> through the mountains of
<i>Yabarim</i> and plains of <i>Moab</i> towards <i>Jordan</i> the face of their march
was West: So that if <i>Judah</i> were strictly to pitch in the East of the
Tabernacle, every night he encamped in the Rear: and if (as some
conceive) the whole Camp could not be less than twelve miles long, it
had been preposterous for him to have marched foremost; or set out first
who was most remote from the place to be approached.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<p>Fiftly, That Learning, Civility and Arts had their beginning in the
East, it is not imputable either to the action of the Sun, or its
Orientality, but the first plantation of Man in those parts, which unto
<i>Europe</i> do carry the respect of East. <span class="sidenote"><i>Where the Ark rested as
some think.</i></span> For on the mountains of <i>Ararat</i>, that is part of the hill
<i>Taurus</i>, between the <i>East Indies</i> and <i>Scythia</i>, as Sir <i>W. Raleigh</i>
accounts it, the Ark of <i>Noah</i> rested; from the East they travelled that
built the Tower of <i>Babel</i>: from thence they were dispersed and
successively enlarged, and Learning, good Arts, and all Civility
communicated. The progression whereof was very sensible; and if we
consider the distance of time between the confusion of <i>Babel</i>, and the
Civility of many parts now eminent therein, it travelled late and slowly
into our quarters. For notwithstanding the learning of <i>Bardes</i> and
<i>Druides</i> of elder times, he that shall peruse that work of <i>Tacitus de
moribus Germanorum</i>, may easily discern how little Civility two thousand
years had wrought upon that Nation: the like he may observe concerning
our selves, from the same Author in the life of <i>Agricola</i>, and more
directly from <i>Strabo</i>; who to the dishonour of our Predecessors, and
the disparagement of those that glory in the Antiquity of their
Ancestors, affirmeth the <i>Britains</i> were so simple, that though they
abounded in Milk, they had not the Artifice of Cheese.</p>

<p>Lastly, That the Globe it self is by Cosmographers divided into East and
West, accounting from the first Meridian, it doth not establish this
conceit. For that division is not naturally founded, but artificially
set down, and by agreement; as the aptest terms to define or
commensurate the longitude of places. Thus the ancient Cosmographers do
place the division of the East and Western Hemisphere, that is the first
term<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span> of longitude in the Canary or fortunate Islands; conceiving these
parts the extreamest habitations Westward: But the Moderns have altered
that term, and translated it unto the Azores or Islands of St.
<i>Michael</i>; and that upon a plausible conceit of the small or insensible
variation of the Compass in those parts, wherein nevertheless, and
though upon second invention, they proceed upon a common and no
appropriate foundation; for even in that Meridian farther North or South
the Compass observably varieth; and there are also other places wherein
it varieth not, as <i>Alphonso</i> and <i>Rodoriges de Lago</i> will have it about
<i>Capo de las Agullas</i> in <i>Africa</i>; as <i>Maurolycus</i> affirmeth in the

<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of the River <i>Nilus</i>.</span></h2>


<p>Hereof uncontroulably and under general consent many opinions are
passant, which notwithstanding upon due examination, do admit of doubt
or restriction. It is generally esteemed, and by most unto our days
received, that the River of <i>Nilus</i> hath seven ostiaries; that is, by
seven Channels disburdeneth it self into the Sea. Wherein
notwithstanding, beside that we find no concurrent determination of ages
past, and a positive and undeniable refute of these present, the
affirmative is mutable, and must not be received without all limitation.</p>

<p>For some, from whom we receive the greatest illustrations of Antiquity,
have made no mention hereof: So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span> <i>Homer</i> hath given no number of its
Channels, nor so much as the name thereof in use with all Historians.
<i>Eratosthenes</i> in his description of <i>Egypt</i> hath likewise passed them
over. <span class="sidenote">How Egypt first became firm land.</span> <i>Aristotle</i> is so
indistinct in their names and numbers, that in the first <i>of Meteors</i> he
plainly affirmeth the Region of <i>Egypt</i> (which we esteem the ancientest
Nation in the world) was a meer gained ground, and that by the setling
of mud and limous matter brought down by the River <i>Nilus</i>, that which
was at first a continued Sea, was raised at last into a firm and
habitable Country. The like opinion he held of <i>M√¶otis Palus</i>, that by
the floods of <i>Tanais</i> and earth brought down thereby, it grew
observably shallower in his days, and would in process of time become a
firm land. And though his conjecture be not as yet fulfilled, yet is the
like observable in the River <i>Gihon</i>, a branch of <i>Euphrates</i> and River
of Paradise; which having in former Ages discharged it self into the
<i>Persian</i> Sea, doth at present fall short; being lost in the lakes of
<i>Chaldea</i>, and hath left between the Sea, a large and considerable part
of dry land.</p>

<p>Others expresly treating hereof, have diversly delivered themselves;
<i>Herodotus</i> in his Euterpe makes mention of seven; but carelesly of two
thereof; that is <i>Bolbitinum</i>, and <i>Bucolicum</i>; for these, saith he,
were not the natural currents, but made by Art for some occasional
convenience. <i>Strabo</i> in his Geography naming but two, <i>Peleusiacum</i> and
<i>Canopicum</i>, plainly affirmeth there were many more than seven; <i>Inter
h√¶c alia quinque</i>, etc. There are (saith he) many remarkable towns
within the currents of Nile, especially such which have given the names
unto the ostiaries thereof, not unto all, for they are eleven, and four
besides, but unto seven and most considerable; that is <i>Canopicum</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
<i>Bolbitinum</i>, <i>Selenneticum</i>, <i>Sebenneticum</i>, <i>Pharniticum</i>,
<i>Mendesium</i>, <i>Taniticum</i> and <i>Pelusium</i>: wherein to make up the number,
one of the artificial chanels of <i>Herodotus</i> is accounted. <i>Ptolomy</i> an
<i>Egyptian</i>, and born at the <i>Pelusian</i> mouth of <i>Nile</i>, in his Geography
maketh nine: and in the third Map of <i>Africa</i>, hath unto their mouths
prefixed their several names; <i>Heracleoticum</i>, <i>Bolbitinum</i>,
<i>Sebenneticum</i>, <i>Pineptum</i>, <i>Diolcos</i>, <i>Pathmeticum</i>, <i>Mendesium</i>,
<i>Taniticum</i>, <i>Peleusiacum</i>: wherein notwithstanding there are no less
then three different names from those delivered by <i>Pliny</i>. All which
considered, we may easily discern that Authors accord not either in name
or number; and must needs confirm the Judgement of <i>Maginus</i>, <i>de
Ostiorum Nili numero et nominibus, valde antiqui scriptores discordant</i>.</p>

<p>Modern Geographers and travellers do much abate of this number, for as
<i>Maginus</i> and others observe, there are now but three or four mouths
thereof; as <i>Gulielmus Tyrius</i> long ago, and <i>Bellonius</i> since, both
ocular enquirers, with others have attested. For below <i>Cairo</i>, the
River divides it self into four branches, whereof two make the chief and
navigable streams, the one running to <i>Pelusium</i> of the Ancients, and
now <i>Damiata</i>; the other unto <i>Canopium</i>, and now <i>Roscetta</i>; the other
two, saith Mr. <i>Sandys</i>,<span class="sidenote15">Sand. Relation.</span> do run between these; but
poor in water. Of those seven mentioned by <i>Herodotus</i>, and those nine
by <i>Ptolomy</i>, these are all I could either see or hear of. Which much
confirmeth the testimony of the Bishop of <i>Tyre</i> a diligent and ocular
Enquirer; who in his holy war doth thus deliver himself. We wonder much
at the Ancients, who assigned seven mouths unto <i>Nilus</i>; which we can no
otherwise salve, then that by process of time, the face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span> of places is
altered, and the river hath lost his chanels; or that our fore-fathers
did never obtain a true account thereof.</p>

<p>And therefore when it is said in holy Scripture,<span class="sidenote15"><i>Isa.</i> 11. 15,
16.</span> The Lord shall utterly destroy the tongue of the <i>Egyptian</i> sea,
and with his mighty wind he shall shake his hand over the river, and
shall smite it in the seven streams, and make men go over dry-shod. If
this expression concerneth the river <i>Nilus</i>, it must only respect the
seven principal streams. But the place is very obscure, and whether
thereby be not meant the river <i>Euphrates</i>, is not without some
controversie; as is collectible from the subsequent words; And there
shall be an high way for the remnant of his people, that shall be left
from <i>Assyria</i>; and also from the bare name <i>River</i>, emphatically
signifying <i>Euphrates</i>, and thereby the division of the <i>Assyrian</i>
Empire into many fractions, which might facilitate their return:<span class="sidenote">Gr. Not in Isaiam.</span> as
<i>Grotius</i> hath observed; and is more plainly made out, <span class="sidenote"><i>Esdr.</i> 2. 13, 43, 47.</span>if the <i>Apocrypha</i> of <i>Esdras</i>,
and that of the <i>Apocalyps</i><span class="sidenote"><i>Apoc.</i> 16. 12.</span> have any relation
hereto.</p>

<p>Lastly, Whatever was or is their number, the contrivers of Cards and
Maps afford us no assurance or constant description therein. For whereas
<i>Ptolemy</i> hath set forth nine, <i>Hondius</i> in his Map of <i>Africa</i> makes
but eight, and in that of <i>Europe</i> ten. <i>Ortelius</i> in the Map of the
<i>Turkish</i> Empire, setteth down eight, in that of <i>Egypt</i> eleven; and
<i>Maginus</i> in his Map of that Country hath observed the same number. And
if we enquire farther, we shall find the same diversity and discord in
divers others.</p>

<p>Thus may we perceive that this account was differently related by the
Ancients, that it is undeniably rejected by the Moderns, and must be
warily received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span> by any. For if we receive them all into account, they
were more then seven, if only the natural sluces, they were fewer; and
however we receive them, there is no agreeable and constant description
thereof. And therefore how reasonable it is to draw continual and
durable deductions from alterable and uncertain foundations; let them
consider who make the gates of <i>Thebes</i>, and the mouths of this River a
constant and continued periphrasis for this number, and in their
Poetical expressions do give the River that Epithite unto this day.</p>

<p>The same River is also accounted the greatest of the earth, called
therefore <i>Fluviorum pater</i>, and <i>totius Orbis maximus</i>, by <i>Ortelius</i>:
If this be true, many Maps must be corrected, or the relations of divers
good Authors renounced.</p>

<p>For first, In the deliniations of many Maps of <i>Africa</i>, the River
<i>Niger</i> exceedeth it about ten degrees in length, that is, no less then
six hundred miles. For arising beyond the √Üquator it maketh Northward
almost 15 degrees, and deflecting after Westward, without Meanders,
continueth a strait course about 40 degrees; and at length with many
great currents disburdeneth it self into the Occidental Ocean. Again, if
we credit the descriptions of good Authors, other Rivers excell it in
length, or breadth, or both. <i>Arrianus</i> in his history of <i>Alexander</i>,
assigneth the first place unto the River <i>Ganges</i>; which truly according
unto latter relations, if not in length, yet in breadth and depth may be
granted to excell it. For the magnitude of <i>Nilus</i> consisteth in the
dimension of longitude, and is inconsiderable in the other; what stream
it maintaineth beyond <i>Syene</i> or <i>Asna</i>, and so forward unto its
original, relations are very imperfect;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span> but below these places, and
farther removed from the head, the current is but narrow, and we read in
the History of the <i>Turks</i>, the <i>Tartar</i> horsemen of <i>Selimus</i> swam over
the <i>Nile</i> from <i>Cairo</i>, to meet the forces of <i>Tonumbeus</i>. Baptista
Scortia expresly treating hereof, <span class="sidenote"><i>De natura et incremento Nili.</i></span>
preferreth the River of <i>Plate</i> in <i>America</i>; for that as <i>Maffeus</i> hath
delivered, falleth into the Ocean in the latitude of forty leagues; and
with that source and plenty that men at Sea do tast fresh water, before
they approach so near as to discover the land. So is it exceeded by that
which by <i>Cardan</i> is termed the greatest in the world, that is the River
<i>Oregliana</i> in the same continent; which as <i>Maginus</i> delivereth, hath
been navigated 6000 miles; and opens in a chanel of ninety leagues
broad; so that, as <i>Acosta</i>, an ocular witness recordeth, they that sail
in the middle, can make no land of either side.</p>

<p>Now the ground of this assertion was surely the magnifying esteem of the
Ancients, arising from the indiscovery of its head. For as things
unknown seem greater then they are, and are usually received with
amplifications above their nature; so might it also be with this River,
whose head being unknown and drawn to a proverbial obscurity, the
opinion thereof became without bounds; and men must needs conceit a
large extent of that to which the discovery of no man had set a period.
And this an usual way to give the superlative unto things of eminency in
any kind; and when a thing is very great, presently to define it to be
the greatest of all. Whereas indeed Superlatives are difficult; whereof
there being but one in every kind, their determinations are dangerous,
and must not be made without great circumspection. <span class="sidenote"><i>The greatest
Cities of the World.</i></span> So the City of Rome is magnified by the <i>Latines</i>
to be the greatest of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span> the earth; but time and Geography informs <i>us</i>,
that <i>Cairo</i> is bigger, and <i>Quinsay</i> in <i>China</i> far exceedeth both.
<span class="sidenote">The highest Hills.</span> So is <i>Olympus</i> extolled by the <i>Greeks</i>, as an
hill attaining unto heaven; but the enlarged Geography of aftertimes
makes slight account hereof, when they discourse of <i>Andes</i> in <i>Peru</i>,
or <i>Teneriffa</i> in the <i>Canaries</i>. And we understand by a person who hath
lately had a fair opportunity to behold the magnified mount <i>Olympus</i>,
that it is exceeded by some peakes of the <i>Alpes</i>. So have all Ages
conceived, and most are still ready to swear, the Wren is the least of
Birds; yet the discoveries of <i>America</i>, and even of our own Plantations
have shewed us one far less; that is, the Humbird,<span class="sidenote10">Tomineio.</span> not
much exceeding a Beetle. And truly, for the least and greatest, the
highest and the lowest of every kind, as it is very difficult to define
them in visible things, so is it to understand in things invisible. Thus
is it no easie lesson to comprehend the first matter, and the affections
of that which is next neighbour unto nothing, but impossible truly to
comprehend God, who indeed is all in all. For things as they arise unto
perfection, and approach unto God, or descend to imperfection, and draw
nearer unto nothing, fall both imperfectly into our apprehensions; the
one being too weak for our conceptions, our conceptions too weak for the
other.</p>

<p>Thirdly, Divers conceptions there are concerning its increment or
inundation. The first unwarily opinions, that this encrease or annual
overflowing is proper unto <i>Nile</i>, and not agreeable unto any other
River; which notwithstanding is common unto many Currents of <i>Africa</i>.
For about the same time the River <i>Niger</i> and <i>Zaire</i> do overflow; and
so do the Rivers beyond the mountains of the Moon, as <i>Suama</i>, and
<i>Spirito<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span> Santo</i>. And not only these in <i>Africa</i>, but some also in
<i>Europe</i> and <i>Asia</i>; for so it is reported of <i>Menan</i> in <i>India</i>, and so
doth <i>Botero</i> report of <i>Duina</i> in <i>Livonia</i>; and the same is also
observable in the River <i>Jordan</i> in <i>Judea</i>; for so is it delivered,
that <i>Jordan</i> overfloweth all his banks in the time of harvest.</p>

<p>The effect indeed is wonderful in all, and the causes surely best
resolvable from observations made in the Countries themselves, the parts
through which they pass, or whence they take their Original. That of
<i>Nilus</i> hath been attempted by Many, and by some to that despair of
resolution, that they have only referred it unto the Providence of God,
and his secret manuduction of all things unto their ends. <span class="sidenote">The cause
of the overflowing of Nilus.</span> But divers have attained the truth, and
the cause alledged by <i>Diodorus</i>, <i>Seneca</i>, <i>Strabo</i>, and others, is
allowable; that the inundation of <i>Nilus</i> in <i>Egypt</i> proceeded from the
rains in <i>√Üthiopia</i>, and the mighty source of waters falling towards the
fountains thereof. For this inundation unto the <i>Egyptians</i> happeneth
when it is winter unto the <i>√Üthiopians</i>; which habitations, although
they have no cold Winter (the Sun being no farther removed from them in
Cancer, then unto us in Taurus) yet is the fervour of the air so well
remitted, as it admits a sufficient generation of vapors, and plenty of
showers ensuing thereupon. This Theory of the Ancients is since
confirmed by experience of the Moderns; by <i>Franciscus Alvarez</i>, who
lived long in those parts, and left a description of <i>√Üthiopia</i>;
affirming that from the middle of June unto September, there fell in his
time continual rains. As also <i>Antonius Ferdinandus</i>, who in an Epistle
written from thence, and noted by <i>Codignus</i>, affirmeth, that during the
winter, in those Countries there passed no day without rain.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>

<p>Now this is also usual, to translate a remarkable quality into a
propriety, and where we admire an effect in one, to opinion there is not
the like in any other. With these conceits do common apprehensions
entertain the antidotal and wondrous condition of <i>Ireland</i>; conceiving
only in that land an immunity from venemous creatures: but unto him that
shall further enquire, the same will be affirmed of <i>Creta</i>, memorable
in ancient stories, even unto fabulous causes, and benediction from the
birth of <i>Jupiter</i>. The same is also found in <i>Ebusus</i> or <i>Evisa</i>, an
Island near <i>Majorca</i> upon the coast of <i>Spain</i>. With these
apprehensions do the eyes of neighbour Spectators behold <i>√Ütna</i>, the
flaming mountain in <i>Sicilia</i>; but Navigators tell us there is a burning
mountain in Island, a more remarkable one in <i>Teneriffa</i> of the
<i>Canaries</i>, and many Vulcano&rsquo;s or fiery Hils elsewhere. Thus Crocodiles
were thought to be peculiar unto <i>Nile</i>, and the opinion so possessed
<i>Alexander</i>, that when he had discovered some in <i>Ganges</i>, he fell upon
a conceit he had found the head of <i>Nilus</i>; but later discoveries affirm
they are not only in <i>Asia</i> and <i>Africa</i>, but very frequent in some
rivers of <i>America</i>.</p>

<p>Another opinion confineth its Inundation, and positively affirmeth, it
constantly encreaseth the seventeenth day of June; wherein perhaps a
larger form of speech were safer, then that which punctually prefixeth a
constant day thereto. For this expression is different from that of the
Ancients, as <i>Herodotus</i>, <i>Diodorus</i>, <i>Seneca</i>, etc. delivering only
that it happeneth about the entrance of the Sun into Cancer; wherein
they warily deliver themselves, and reserve a reasonable latitude. So
when <i>Hippocrates</i> saith, <i>Sub Cane et ante Canem difficiles sunt
purgationes</i>: There is a latitude of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span> days comprised therein; for under
the Dog-star he containeth not only the day of its ascent, but many
following, and some ten days preceeding. So <i>Aristotle</i> delivers the
affections of animals: with the wary terms of <i>Circa, et magna ex
parte</i>: and when <i>Theodorus</i> translateth that part of his, <i>Coeunt
Thunni et Scombri mense Februario post Idus, pariunt Junio ante Nonas</i>:
<i>Scaliger</i> for <i>ante Nonas</i>, renders it <i>Junii initio</i>; because that
exposition affordeth the latitude of divers days: For affirming it
happeneth before the Nones, he alloweth but one day; that is the
Calends; for in the <i>Roman</i> account, the second day is the fourth of the
Nones of June.</p>

<p>Again, Were the day definitive, it had prevented the delusion of the
devil, nor could he have gained applause by its prediction; who
notwithstanding (as <i>Athanasius</i> in the life of <i>Anthony</i> relateth) to
magnifie his knowledge in things to come, when he perceived the rains to
fall in <i>√Üthiopia</i>, would presage unto the <i>Egyptians</i> the day of its
inundation. And this would also make useless that natural experiment
observed in earth or sand about the River; by the weight whereof (as
good Authors report) they have unto this day a knowledge of its
encrease.</p>

<p>Lastly, It is not reasonable from variable and unstable causes, to
derive a fixed and constant effect, and such are the causes of this
inundation, which cannot indeed be regular, and therefore their effects
not prognosticable like Eclipses. For depending upon the clouds and
descent of showers in <i>√Üthiopia</i>, which have their generation from
vaporous exhalations, they must submit their existence unto
contingencies, and endure anticipation and recession from the movable
condition of their causes. And therefore some years there hath been no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
encrease at all, as some conceive in the years of Famin under <i>Pharaoh</i>,
as <i>Seneca</i>, and divers relate of the eleventh year of <i>Cleopatra</i>; nor
nine years together, as is testified by <i>Calisthenes</i>. Some years it
hath also retarded, and came far later then usually it was expected, as
according to <i>Sozomen</i> and <i>Nicephorus</i> it happened in the days of
<i>Theodosius</i>; whereat the people were ready to mutiny, because they
might not sacrifice unto the River, according to the custom of their
Predecessors.</p>

<p>Now this is also an usual way of mistake, and many are deceived who too
strictly construe the temporal considerations of things. Thus books will
tell us, and we are made to believe that the fourteenth year males are
seminifical and pubescent; but he that shall enquire into the
generality, will rather adhere unto the cautelous assertion of
<i>Aristotle</i>, that is, <i>bis septem annis exactis</i>, and then but <i>magna ex
parte</i>. That Whelps are blind nine days, and then begin to see, is
generally believed, but as we have elsewhere declared, it is exceeding
rare, nor do their eye-lids usually open until the twelfth, and
sometimes not before the fourteenth day. And to speak strictly, an
hazardable determination it is unto fluctuating and indifferent effects,
to affix a positive Type or Period. For in effects of far more regular
causalities, difficulties do often arise, and even in time it self,
which measureth all things, we use allowance in its commensuration. Thus
while we conceive we have the account of a year in 365 days, exact
enquirers and Computists will tell us, that we escape 6 hours, that is a
quarter of a day. And so in a day which every one accounts 24 hours, or
one revolution of the Sun, in strict account we must allow the addition
of such a part as the Sun doth make in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span> proper motion, from West to
East, whereby in one day he describeth not a perfect Circle.</p>

<p>Fourthly, It is affirmed by many, and received by most, that it never
raineth in <i>Egypt</i>, the river supplying that defect, and bountifully
requiting it in its inundation: but this must also be received in a
qualified sense, that is, that it rains but seldom at any time in the
Summer, and very rarely in the Winter. <span class="sidenote"><i>That</i> Egypt <i>hath rain</i>.</span>
But that great showers do sometimes fall upon that Region, beside the
Assertion of many Writers,<span class="sidenote"><i>Sir</i> William Paston <i>Baronet</i>.</span>, we can
confirm from honourable and ocular testimony, and that not many years
past, it rained in Grand <i>Cairo</i> divers days together.</p>

<p>The same is also attested concerning other parts of <i>Egypt</i>, by <i>Prosper
Alpinus</i>, who lived long in that Country, and hath left an accurate
Treaty of the medical practise thereof. <i>Cayri raro decidunt pluvi√¶,
Alexandri√¶, Pelusiiq; et in omnibus locis mari adjacentibus, pluit
largissime et s√¶pe</i>; that is, it raineth seldom at <i>Cairo</i>, but at
<i>Alexandria</i>, <i>Damiata</i>, and places near the Sea, it raineth plentifully
and often. Whereto we might add the latter testimony of Learned Mr.
<i>Greaves</i>, in his accurate description of the <i>Pyramids</i>.</p>

<p>Beside, Men hereby forget the relation of holy Scripture. <span class="sidenote10"><i>Exod.</i>
9.</span> <i>Behold I will cause it to rain a very great hail, such as hath not
been in</i> Egypt <i>since the foundation thereof, even untill now</i>. Wherein
God threatning such a rain as had not happened, it must be presumed they
had been acquainted with some before, and were not ignorant of the
substance, the menace being made in the circumstance. The same
concerning hail is inferrible from <i>Prosper Alpinus. Rarissime nix,
grando</i>, it seldom snoweth or haileth. Where by we must concede that
snow and hail do sometimes fall, because they happen seldom.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>

<p>Now this mistake ariseth from a misapplication of the bounds or limits
of time, and an undue transition from one unto another; which to avoid,
we must observe the punctual differences of time, and so distinguish
thereof, as not to confound or lose the one in the other. For things may
come to pass, <i>Semper, Plerumq; S√¶pe, aut Nunquam, Aliquando, Raro</i>;
that is, Always, or Never, For the most part, or Sometimes, Ofttimes, or
Seldom. Now the deception is usual which is made by the mis-application
of these; men presently concluding that to happen often, which happeneth
but sometimes: that never, which happeneth but seldom; and that alway,
which happeneth for the most part. So is it said, the Sun shines every
day in Rhodes, because for the most part it faileth not. So we say and
believe that a Camelion never eateth, but liveth only upon air, whereas
indeed it is seen to eat very seldom, but many there are who have beheld
it to feed on Flyes. And so it is said, that children born in the eighth
moneth live not, that is, for the most part, but not to be concluded
alwaies: nor it seems in former ages in all places: for it is otherwise
recorded by <i>Aristotle</i> concerning the births of <i>Egypt</i>.</p>

<p>Lastly, It is commonly conceived that divers Princes hath attempted to
cut the Isthmus or tract of land<span class="sidenote">Lingua maris √Ügyptii. <i>Isa. 11.
15.</i></span> which parteth the <i>Arabian</i> and <i>Mediterranean</i> Sea: but upon
enquiry I find some difficulty concerning the place attempted; many with
good authority affirming, that the intent was not immediately to unite
these Seas, but to make a navigable chanel between the Red Sea and the
Nile, the marks whereof are extant to this day; it was first attempted
by <i>Sesostris</i>, after by <i>Darius</i>, and in a fear to drown the Country,
deserted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span> by them both; but was long after re-attempted and in some
manner effected by <i>Philadelphus</i>. And so the grand Signior who is Lord
of the Country, conveyeth his Gallies into the Red Sea by the Nile; for
he bringeth them down to Grand <i>Cairo</i> where they are taken in pieces,
carried upon Camels backs, and rejoyned together at Sues, his port and
Naval station for that Sea; whereby in effect he acts the design of
<i>Cleopatra</i>, who after the battle of <i>Actium</i> in a different way would
have conveyed her Gallies into the Red Sea.</p>

<p>And therefore that proverb to cut an Isthmus,<span class="sidenote">Isthmum perfodere.</span>
that is, to take great pains, and effect nothing, alludeth not unto this
attempt; but is by <i>Erasmus</i> applyed unto several other, as that
undertaking of the Cnidians to cut their Isthmus, but especially that of
<i>Corinth</i> so unsuccessfully attempted by many Emperours. The Cnidians
were deterred by the peremptory disswasion of <i>Apollo</i>, plainly
commanding them to desist; for if God had thought it fit, he would have
made that Country an Island at first. But this perhaps will not be
thought a reasonable discouragement unto the activity of those spirits
which endeavour to advantage nature by Art, and upon good grounds to
promote any part of the universe; nor will the ill success of some be
made a sufficient determent unto others; who know that many learned men
affirm, that Islands were not from the beginning, that many have been
made since by Art, that some Isthmus have been eat through by the Sea,
and others cut by the spade: And if policy would permit, that of
<i>Panama</i> in <i>America</i> were most worthy the attempt: it being but few
miles over, and would open a shorter cut unto the East Indies and
China.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX_PE_VI" id="CHAPTER_IX_PE_VI">CHAPTER IX</a>
<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of the Red Sea.</span></h2>


<p>Contrary apprehensions are made of the Erythr√¶an or Red Sea; most
apprehending a material redness therein, from whence they derive its
common denomination; and some so lightly conceiving hereof, as if it had
no redness at all, are fain to recur unto other originals of its
appellation. <span class="sidenote"><i>What the Red Sea is.</i></span> Wherein to deliver a distinct
account, we first observe that without consideration of colour it is
named the <i>Arabian Gulph</i>: The Hebrews who had best reason to remember
it, do call it <i>Zuph</i>, or the weedy Sea; because it was full of sedge,
or they found it so in their passage; the <i>Mahometans</i> who are now lords
thereof do know it by no other name then the <i>Gulph</i> of <i>Mecha</i> a City
of <i>Arabia</i>.</p>

<p>The stream of Antiquity deriveth its name from King <i>Erythrus</i>; so
sleightly conceiving of the nominal deduction from Redness, that they
plainly deny there is any such accident in it. The words of <i>Curtius</i>
are plain beyond Evasion, <i>Ab Erythro rege inditum est nomen, propter
quod ignari rubere aquas credunt</i>: Of no more obscurity are the words of
<i>Philostratus</i>, and of later times, <i>Sabellicus; Stulte persuasam est
vulgo rubras alicubi esse maris aquas, quin ab Erythro rege nomen pelago
inditum</i>. <span class="sidenote"><i>More exactly hereof</i>
Bochartus <i>and Mr.</i> Dickinson.</span> Of this opinion was <i>Andr√¶as Corsalius</i>, <i>Pliny</i>, <i>Solinus</i>,
<i>Dio Cassius</i>, who although they denied not all redness, yet did they
rely upon the original from King <i>Erythrus</i>.</p>

<p>Others have fallen upon the like, or perhaps the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span> same conceit under
another appellation; deducing its name not from King <i>Erythrus</i>, but
<i>Esau</i> or <i>Edom</i>, whose habitation was upon the coasts thereof. Now
<i>Edom</i> is as much as <i>Erythrus</i>, and the red Sea no more then the
<i>Idumean</i>; from whence the posterity of <i>Edom</i> removing towards the
Mediterranean coast, according to their former nomination by the Greeks
were called Ph≈ìnicians or red men: and from a plantation and colony
of theirs, an Island near Spain was by the Greek describers termed
<i>Erithra</i>, as is declared by <i>Strabo</i> and <i>Solinus</i>.</p>

<p>Very many omitting the nominal derivation, do rest in the gross and
literal conception thereof, apprehending a real redness and constant
colour of parts. Of which opinion are also they which hold the Sea
receiveth a red and minious tincture from springs, wells, and currents
that fall into it; and of the same belief are probably many Christians,
who conceiving the passage of the <i>Israelites</i> through this Sea to have
been the type of Baptism, according to that of the Apostle,<span class="sidenote15">1 <i>Cor.</i>
10. 2.</span> All were baptized unto <i>Moses</i> in the cloud, and in the Sea:
for the better resemblance of the blood of Christ, they willingly
received it in the apprehension of redness, and a colour agreeable unto
its mystery: according unto that of <i>Austin</i>,  <span class="sidenote">Aug. in Johannem.</span><i>Significat mare illud
rubrum Baptismum Christi; unde nobis Baptismus Christi nisi sanguine
Christi consecratus</i>?</p>

<p>But divers Moderns not considering these conceptions, and appealing unto
the Testimony of sense, have at last determined the point: concluding a
redness herein, but not in the sense received. Sir <i>Walter Raleigh</i> from
his own and <i>Portugal</i> observations, doth place the redness of the Sea
in the reflection from red Islands, and the redness of the earth at the
bottom:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span> wherein Coral grows very plentifully, and from whence in great
abundance it is transported into <i>Europe</i>. The observations of
<i>Alberquerque</i> and <i>Stephanus de Gama</i> (as from <i>Johannes de Bairros</i>,
<i>Fernandius de Cordova</i> relateth) derive this redness from the colour of
the sand and argillous earth at the bottom; for being a shallow Sea,
while it rowleth to and fro, there appeareth a redness upon the water,
which is most discernable in sunny and windy weather. But that this is
no more than a seeming redness, he confirmeth by an experiment; for in
the reddest part taking up a vessel of water, it differed not from the
complexion of other Seas. Nor is this colour discoverable in every place
of that Sea, for as he also observeth, in some places it is very green,
in others white and yellow, according to the colour of the earth or sand
at the bottom. And so may <i>Philostratus</i> be made out, when he saith,
this Sea is blew; or <i>Bellonius</i> denying this redness, because he beheld
not that colour about Sues; or when <i>Corsalius</i> at the mouth thereof
could not discover the same.</p>

<p>Now although we have enquired the ground of redness in this Sea, yet are
we not fully satisfied: for what is forgot by many, and known by few,
there is another Red Sea whose name we pretend not to make out from
these principles; that is, the <i>Persian</i> Gulph or Bay, which divideth
the <i>Arabian</i> and <i>Persian</i> shore, as <i>Pliny</i> hath described it. <i>Mare
rubrum in duos dividitur sinus, is qui ab Oriente est, Persicus
appellatur</i>; or as <i>Solinus</i> expresseth it, <i>Qui ab Oriente est Persicus
appellatur, ex adverso unde Arabia est, Arabicus</i>: whereto assenteth
<i>Suidas</i>, <i>Ortelius</i>, and many more. And therefore there is no absurdity
in <i>Strabo</i> when he delivereth that <i>Tigris</i> and <i>Euphrates</i> do fall
into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span> Red Sea, and <i>Fernandius de Cordova</i> justly defendeth his
Countryman <i>Seneca</i> in that expression;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="line"><i>Et qui renatum prorsus excipiens diem</i></div>
<div class="line"><i>Tepidum Rubenti Tigrin immiscet freto.</i></div>
</div></div>

<p>Nor hath only the <i>Persian</i> Sea received the same name with the
<i>Arabian</i>, but what is strange, and much confounds the distinction, the
name thereof is also derived from King <i>Erythrus</i>; who was conceived to
be buried in an Island of this Sea, as <i>Dionysius Afer</i>, <i>Curtius</i> and
<i>Suidas</i> do deliver. Which were of no less probability than the other,
if (as with the same authors <i>Strabo</i> affirmeth) he was buried neer
<i>Caramania</i> bordering upon the <i>Persian</i> Gulph. And if his Tomb was seen
by <i>Nearchus</i>, it was not so likely to be in the <i>Arabian</i> Gulph; for we
read that from the River <i>Indus</i> he came unto <i>Alexander</i> at <i>Babylon</i>,
some few days before his death. Now <i>Babylon</i> was seated upon the River
<i>Euphrates</i>, which runs into the <i>Persian</i> Gulph. And therefore however
the Latin expresseth it in <i>Strabo</i>, that <i>Nearchus</i> suffered much in
the <i>Arabian Sinus</i>, yet is the original Œ∫œåŒªœÄŒøœÇ œÄŒ≠œÅœÉŒπŒ∫ŒøœÇ, that is, the
Gulf of <i>Persia</i>.</p>

<p>That therefore the Red Sea or <i>Arabian</i> Gulph received its name from
personal derivation, though probable, is but uncertain; that both the
Seas of one name should have one common denominator, less probable; that
there is a gross and material redness in either, not to be affirmed:
that there is an emphatical or appearing redness in one, not well to be
denied. And this is sufficient to make good the Allegory of the
Christians: and in this distinction may we justifie the name of the
Black Sea, given unto <i>Pontus Euxinus:</i> the name of <i>Xanthus</i>, or the
yellow River of <i>Phrygia</i>:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span> and the name of <i>Mar Vermeio</i>, or the Red
Sea in <i>America</i>.</p>

<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of the Blackness of <i>Negroes</i>.</span></h2>


<p>It is evident not only in the general frame of Nature, that things most
manifest unto sense, have proved obscure unto the understanding: But
even in proper and appropriate Objects, wherein we affirm the sense
cannot err, the faculties of reason most often fail us. Thus of colours
in general, under whose gloss and vernish all things are seen, few or
none have yet beheld the true nature; or positively set down their
incontroulable causes. Which while some ascribe unto the mixture of the
Elements, others to the graduality of Opacity and Light; they have left
our endeavours to grope them out by twi-light, and by darkness almost to
discover that whose existence is evidenced by Light. <span class="sidenote"><i>The
Principles of Colour according to the</i> Chymists.</span> The <i>Chymists</i> have
laudably reduced their causes unto Sal, Sulphur, and Mercury; and had
they made it out so well in this, as in the objects of smell and taste,
their endeavours had been more acceptable: For whereas they refer Sapor
unto Salt, and Odor unto Sulphur, they vary much concerning colour; some
reducing it unto Mercury, some to Sulphur; others unto Salt. Wherein
indeed the last conceit doth not oppress the former; and though Sulphur
seem to carry the master-stroak, yet Salt may have a strong
co-operation. For beside the fixed and terrestrious Salt, there is in
natural bodies a <i>Sal niter</i> referring unto Sulphur; there is also a
volatile or Amnoniack Salt, retaining unto Mercury; by which Salts the
colours of bodies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span> are sensibly qualified, and receive degrees of lustre
or obscurity, superficiality or profundity, fixation or volatility.</p>

<p>Their general or first Natures being thus obscure, there will be greater
difficulties in their particular discoveries; for being farther removed
from their simplicities, they fall into more complexed considerations;
and so require a subtiler act of reason to distinguish and call forth
their natures. Thus although a man understood the general nature of
colours, yet were it no easie Problem to resolve, Why Grass is green?
Why Garlick, Molyes, and Porrets have white roots, deep green leaves,
and black seeds? Why several docks and sorts of Rhubarb with yellow
roots, send forth purple flowers? Why also from Lactary or milky plants
which have a white and lacteous juyce dispersed through every part,
there arise flowers blew and yellow? Moreover, beside the specifical and
first digressions ordained from the Creation, which might be urged to
salve the variety in every species; Why shall the marvail of <i>Peru</i>
produce its flowers of different colours, and that not once, or
constantly, but every day, and variously? Why Tulips of one colour
produce some of another, and running through almost all, should still
escape a blew? And lastly, Why some men, yea and they a mighty and
considerable part of mankind, should first acquire and still retain the
gloss and tincture of blackness? Which whoever strictly enquires, shall
find no less of darkness in the cause, than in the effect it self; there
arising unto examination no such satisfactory and unquarrelable reasons,
as may confirm the causes generally received; which are but two in
number. The heat and scorch of the Sun; or the curse of God on <i>Cham</i>
and his Posterity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span></p>

<p>The first was generally received by the Ancients,
who in obscurities had no higher recourse than unto Nature, as may
appear by a Discourse concerning this point in <i>Strabo</i>. By <i>Aristotle</i>
it seems to be implied in those Problems which enquire why the Sun makes
men black, and not the fire? Why it whitens wax, yet blacks the skin? By
the word <i>√Üthiops</i> it self, applied to the memorablest Nations of
<i>Negroes</i>, that is of a burnt and torrid countenance. The fancy of the
Fable infers also the Antiquity of the opinion; which deriveth this
complexion from the deviation of the Sun, and the conflagration of all
things under <i>Phaeton</i>. But this opinion though generally embraced, was
I perceive rejected by <i>Aristobulus</i> a very ancient Geographer; as is
discovered by <i>Strabo</i>. It hath been doubted by several modern Writers,
particularly by <i>Ortelius</i>; but amply and satisfactorily discussed as we
know by no man. We shall therfore endeavour a full delivery hereof,
declaring the grounds of doubt, and reasons of denial, which rightly
understood, may, if not overthrow, yet shrewdly shake the security of
this Assertion.</p>

<p>And first, Many which countenance the opinion in this reason, do tacitly
and upon consequence overthrow it in another. For whilst they make the
River <i>Senaga</i> to divide and bound the <i>Moors</i>, so that on the South
side they are black, on the other only tawny; they imply a secret
causality herein from the air, place or river; and seem not to derive it
from the Sun. The effects of whose activity are not precipitously
abrupted, but gradually proceed to their cessations.</p>

<p>Secondly, If we affirm that this effect proceeded, or as we will not be
backward to concede, it may be advanced and fomented from the fervour of
the Sun;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span> yet do we not hereby discover a principle sufficient to decide
the question concerning other animals; nor doth he that affirmeth the
heat makes man black, afford a reason why other animals in the same
habitations maintain a constant and agreeable hue unto those in other
parts, as Lions, Elephants, Camels, Swans, Tigers, Estriges. Which
though in <i>√Üthiopia</i>, in the disadvantage of two Summers, and
perpendicular Rayes of the Sun, do yet make good the complexion of their
species, and hold a colourable correspondence unto those in milder
regions. Now did this complexion proceed from heat in man, the same
would be communicated unto other animals which equally participate the
Influence of the common Agent. For thus it is in the effects of cold, in
Regions far removed from the Sun; for therein men are not only of fair
complexions, gray-eyed, and of light hair; but many creatures exposed to
the air, deflect in extremity from their natural colours; from brown,
russet and black, receiving the complexion of Winter, and turning
perfect white. Thus <i>Olaus Magnus</i> relates, that after the Autumnal
√Üquinox, Foxes begin to grow white; thus <i>Michovius</i> reporteth, and we
want not ocular confirmation, that Hares and Partridges turn white in
the Winter; and thus a white Crow, a proverbial rarity with us, is none
unto them; but that inseparable accident of <i>Porphyrie</i> is separated in
many hundreds.</p>

<p>Thirdly, If the fervour of the Sun, or intemperate heat of clime did
solely occasion this complexion, surely a migration or change thereof
might cause a sensible, if not a total mutation; which notwithstanding
experience will not admit. For <i>Negroes</i> transplanted, although into
cold and phlegmatick habitations, continue their hue both in themselves,
and also their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span> generations; except they mix with different complexions;
whereby notwithstanding there only succeeds a remission of their
tinctures; there remaining unto many descents a strong shadow of their
Originals; and if they preserve their copulations entire, they still
maintain their complexions. As is very remarkable in the dominions of
the Grand Signior, and most observable in the <i>Moors</i> in <i>Brasilia</i>,
which transplanted about an hundred years past, continue the tinctures
of their fathers unto this day. And so likewise fair or white people
translated in hotter Countries receive not impressions amounting to this
complexion, as hath been observed in many <i>Europeans</i> who have lived in
the land of <i>Negroes</i>: and as <i>Edvardus Lopes</i> testifieth of the
<i>Spanish</i> plantations, that they retained their native complexions unto
his days.</p>

<p>Fourthly, If the fervour of the Sun were the sole cause hereof in
<i>Ethiopia</i> or any land of <i>Negroes</i>, it were also reasonable that
inhabitants of the same latitude, subjected unto the same vicinity of
the Sun, the same diurnal arch, and direction of its rayes, should also
partake of the same hue and complexion, which notwithstanding they do
not. For the Inhabitants of the same latitude in <i>Asia</i> are of a
different complexion, as are the Inhabitants of <i>Cambogia</i> and <i>Java</i>,
insomuch that some conceive the <i>Negro</i> is properly a native of
<i>Africa</i>, and that those places in <i>Asia</i> inhabited now by <i>Moors</i>, are
but the intrusions of <i>Negroes</i> arriving first from <i>Africa</i>, as we
generally conceive of <i>Madagascar</i>, and the adjoyning Islands, who
retain the same complexion unto this day. But this defect is more
remarkable in <i>America</i>; which although subjected unto both the
Tropicks, yet are not the Inhabitants black between, or near, or under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
either; neither to the Southward in <i>Brasilia</i>, <i>Chili</i>, or <i>Peru</i>; nor
yet to the Northward in <i>Hispaniola</i>, <i>Castilia</i>, <i>del Oro</i>, or
<i>Nicaragua</i>. And although in many parts thereof there be at present
swarms of <i>Negroes</i> serving under the <i>Spaniard</i>, yet were they all
transported from <i>Africa</i>, since the discovery of <i>Columbus</i>; and are
not indigenous or proper natives of <i>America</i>.</p>

<p>Fifthly, We cannot conclude this complexion in Nations from the vicinity
or habitude they hold unto the Sun; for even in <i>Africa</i> they be
<i>Negroes</i> under the Southern Tropick, but are not all of this hue either
under or near the Northern. So the people of <i>Gualata</i>, <i>Agades</i>,
<i>Garamantes</i>, and of <i>Goaga</i>, all within the Northern Tropicks are not
<i>Negroes</i>; but on the other side about <i>Capo Negro</i>, <i>Cefala</i>, and
<i>Madagascar</i>, they are of a jetty black.</p>

<p>Now if to salve this Anomaly we say the heat of the Sun is more powerful
in the Southern Tropick, because in the sign of Capricorn fals out the
Perigeum or lowest place of the Sun in his Excentrick, whereby he
becomes nearer unto them than unto the other in Cancer, we shall not
absolve the doubt. And if any insist upon such niceties, and will
presume a different effect of the Sun, from such a difference of place
or vicinity, we shall ballance the same with the concernment of its
motion, and time of revolution, and say he is more powerful in the
Northern Hemisphere, and in the Apogeum; for therein his motion is
slower, and so his heat respectively unto those habitations, as of
duration, so also of more effect. For, though he absolve his revolution
in 365 days, odd hours and minutes, yet by reason of Excentricity, his
motion is unequal, and his course far longer in the Northern Semicircle,
than in the Southern; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span> the latter he passeth in a 178 days, but the
other takes him a 187, that is, eleven days more. So is his presence
more continued unto the Northern Inhabitants; and the longer day in
Cancer is longer unto us, than that in Capricorn unto the Southern
Habitator. Beside, hereby we only infer an inequality of heat in
different Tropicks, but not an equality of effects in other parts
subjected to the same. For, in the same degree, and as near the earth he
makes his revolution unto the <i>American</i>, whose Inhabitants
notwithstanding partake not of the same effect. And if herein we seek a
relief from the Dog-star, we shall introduce an effect proper unto a
few, from a cause common unto many; for upon the same grounds that Star
should have as forcible a power upon <i>America</i> and <i>Asia</i>; and although
it be not vertical unto any part of <i>Asia</i>, but only passeth by <i>Beach</i>,
<i>in terra incognita</i>; yet is it so unto <i>America</i>, and vertically
passeth over the habitations of <i>Peru</i> and <i>Brasilia</i>.</p>

<p>Sixthly, And which is very considerable, there are <i>Negroes</i> in <i>Africa</i>
beyond the Southern Tropick, and some so far removed from it, as
Geographically the clime is not intemperate, that is, near the Cape of
good Hope, in 36 of the Southern Latitude. Whereas in the same elevation
Northward, the Inhabitants of <i>America</i> are fair; and they of <i>Europe</i>
in <i>Candy</i>, <i>Sicily</i>, and some parts of <i>Spain</i>, deserve not properly so
low a name as <i>Tawny</i>.</p>

<p>Lastly, Whereas the <i>Africans</i> are conceived to be more peculiarly
scorched and torrified from the Sun, by addition of driness from the
soil, from want and defect of water, it will not excuse the doubt. For
the parts which the <i>Negroes</i> possess, are not so void of Rivers and
moisture, as is presumed; for on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span> other side the mountains of the
Moon, in that great tract called <i>Zanzibar</i>, there are the mighty Rivers
of <i>Suama</i> and <i>Spirito Santo</i>; on this side, the great River <i>Zaire</i>,
the mighty <i>Nile</i> and <i>Niger</i>; which do not only moisten and
contemperate the air by their exhalations, but refresh and humectate the
earth by their annual Inundations. Beside, in that part of <i>Africa</i>,
which with all disadvantage is most dry, that is, in situation between
the Tropicks, defect of Rivers and inundations, as also abundance of
Sands, the people are not esteemed <i>Negroes</i>; and that is <i>Lybia</i>, which
with the <i>Greeks</i> carries the name of all <i>Africa</i>. A region so desert,
dry and sandy, that Travellers (as <i>Leo</i> reports) are fain to carry
water on their Camels; whereof they find not a drop sometime in six or
seven days. Yet is this Country accounted by Geographers no part of
<i>terra Nigritarum</i>, and <i>Ptolomy</i> placeth herein the <i>Leuco √Üthiops</i>, or
pale and Tawny <i>Moors</i>.</p>

<p>Now the ground of this opinion might be the visible quality of Blackness
observably produced by heat, fire and smoak; but especially with the
Ancients the violent esteem they held of the heat of the Sun, in the hot
or torrid Zone; conceiving that part unhabitable, and therefore that
people in the vicinities or frontiers thereof, could not escape without
this change of their complexions. But how far they were mistaken in this
apprehension, modern Geography hath discovered: And as we have declared,
there are many within this Zone whose complexions descend not so low as
unto blackness. And if we should strictly insist hereon, the possibility
might fall into question; that is, whether the heat of the Sun, whose
fervour may swart a living part, and even black a dead or dissolving
flesh, can yet in animals, whose parts are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span> successive and in continual
flux, produce this deep and perfect gloss of Blackness.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The particular causes of the Negroes blackness probably.</i></div>

<p>Thus having evinced, at least made dubious, the Sun is not the Author of
this Blackness, how, and when this tincture first began is yet a Riddle,
and positively to determine, it surpasseth my presumption. Seeing
therefore we cannot discover what did effect it, it may afford some
piece of satisfaction to know what might procure it. It may be therefore
considered, whether the inward use of certain waters or fountains of
peculiar operations, might not at first produce the effect in question.
For, of the like we have records in <i>Aristotle, Strabo</i> and <i>Pliny</i>, who
hath made a collection hereof, as of two fountains in <i>B≈ìotia</i>, the
one making Sheep white, the other black; of the water of <i>Siberis</i> which
made Oxen black, and the like effect it had also upon men, dying not
only the skin, but making their hairs black and curled. This was the
conceit of <i>Aristobulus</i>, who received so little satisfaction from the
other, or that it might be caused by heat, or any kind of fire, that he
conceived it as reasonable to impute the effect unto water.</p>

<p>Secondly, It may be perpended whether it might not fall out the same way
that <i>Jacobs</i> cattle became speckled, spotted and ring-straked, that is,
by the Power and Efficacy of Imagination; which produceth effects in the
conception correspondent unto the phancy of the Agents in generation;
and sometimes assimilates the Idea of the Generator into a reality in
the thing ingendred. For, hereof there pass for current many indisputed
examples; so in <i>Hippocrates</i> we read of one, that from an intent view
of a Picture conceived a <i>Negro</i>; And in the History of <i>Heliodore</i> of a
Moorish Queen, who upon aspection of the Picture of <i>Andromeda</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
conceived and brought forth a fair one. <span class="sidenote">Vide plura apud <i>Tho.
Fienum</i>, de viribus imaginationis.</span> And thus perhaps might some say was
the beginning of this complexion: induced first by Imagination, which
having once impregnated the seed, found afterward concurrent
co-operation, which were continued by Climes, whose constitution
advantaged the first impression. <span class="sidenote"><i>Why Beares</i> etc. <i>white in some
places.</i></span> Thus <i>Plotinus</i> conceiveth white Peacocks first came in. Thus
many opinion that from aspection of the Snow, which lieth long in
Northern Regions, and high mountains. Hawks, Kites, Beares, and other
creatures become white; and by this way <i>Austin</i> conceiveth the devil
provided, they never wanted a white spotted Ox in <i>Egypt</i>; for such an
one they worshipped, and called <i>Apis</i>.</p>

<p>Thirdly, It is not indisputable whether it might not proceed from such a
cause and the like foundation of Tincture, as doth the black Jaundise,
which meeting with congenerous causes might settle durable inclinations,
and advance their generations unto that hue, which were naturally before
but a degree or two below it. And this transmission we shall the easier
admit in colour, if we remember the like hath been effected in organical
parts and figures; the Symmetry whereof being casually or purposely
perverted; their morbosities have vigorously descended to their
posterities, and that in durable deformities. This was the beginning of
<i>Macrocephali</i>, or people with long heads, whereof <i>Hippocrates</i><span class="sidenote">De
Aere, Aquis, et Locis.</span> hath clearly delivered himself: <i>Cum primum
editus est Infans, caput ejus tenellum manibus effingunt, et in
<a name="CORR9" id="CORR9"><ins class="correction" title="original: lonitudine">logitudine</ins></a> adolescere cogunt; hoc institutum primum hujusmodi, natur√¶
dedit vitium, successu vero temporis in naturam abiit, ut proinde
instituto nihil amplius opus esset; semen enim genitale ex omnibus
corporis partibus provenit, ex sanis quidem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span> sanum, ex morbosis
morbosum. Si igitur ex calvis calvi, ex c√¶ciis c√¶cii, et ex distortis,
ut plurimum, distorti gignuntur, eademque in c√¶teris formis valet ratio,
quid prohibet cur non ex macrocephalis macrocephali gignantur?</i> Thus as
<i>Aristotle</i> observeth, the Deers of <i>Arginusa</i> had their ears divided;
occasioned at first by slitting the ears of Deers. Thus have the
<i>Chineses</i> little feet, most <i>Negroes</i> great Lips and flat Noses; And
thus many <i>Spaniards</i>, and <i>Mediterranean</i> Inhabitants, which are of the
Race of <i>Barbary Moors</i> (although after frequent commixture) have not
worn out the <i>Camoys</i> Nose<span class="sidenote10">Flat Nose.</span> unto this day.</p>

<p>Artificial <i>Negroes</i>, or <i>Gypsies</i> acquire their complexion by anointing
their bodies with Bacon and fat substances, and so exposing them to the
Sun. In <i>Guiny Moors</i> and others, it hath been observed, that they
frequently moisten their skins with fat and oyly materials, to temper
the irksom driness thereof from the parching rayes of the Sun. Whether
this practise at first had not some efficacy toward this complexion, may
also be considered.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>How sundry kinds of Animals come to be found in Islands.</i></div>

<p>Lastly, If we still be urged to particularities, and such as declare
how, and when the seed of <i>Adam</i> did first receive this tincture; we may
say that men became black in the same manner that some Foxes, Squirrels,
Lions, first turned of this complexion, whereof there are a constant
sort in divers Countries; that some Chaughs came to have red Legs and
Bils, that Crows became pyed: All which mutations however they began,
depend on durable foundations; and such as may continue for ever. And if
as yet we must farther define the cause and manner of this mutation, we
must confess, in matters of Antiquity, and such as are decided by
History, if their Originals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span> and first beginnings escape a due relation,
they fall into great obscurities, and such as future Ages seldom reduce
unto a resolution. Thus if you deduct the administration of Angels, and
that they dispersed the creatures into all parts after the flood, as
they had congregated them into <i>Noahs</i> Ark before; it will be no easie
question to resolve, how several sorts of animals were first dispersed
into Islands, and almost how any into <i>America</i>: How the venereal
Contagion began in that part of the earth, since history is silent, is
not easily resolved by Philosophy. For whereas it is imputed unto
Anthropophagy, or the eating of mans flesh; that cause hath been common
unto many other Countries, and there have been Canibals or men eaters in
the three other parts of the world, if we credit the relations of
<i>Ptolomy</i>, <i>Strabo</i> and <i>Pliny</i>. And thus if the favourable pen of
<i>Moses</i> had not revealed the confusion of tongues, and positively
declared their division at <i>Babel</i>, our disputes concerning their
beginning had been without end; <span class="sidenote">Elias cum venerit solvet dubium.</span>and I fear we must have left the hopes
of that decision unto <i>Elias</i>. </p>

<p>And if any will yet insist, and urge the question farther still upon me,
I shall be enforced unto divers of the like nature, wherein perhaps I
shall receive no greater satisfaction. I shall demand how the Camels of
<i>Bactria</i> came to have two bunches on their backs, whereas the Camels of
<i>Arabia</i> in all relations have but one? How Oxen in some Countries began
and continue gibbous or bunch-back&rsquo;d? what way those many different
shapes, colours, hairs, and natures of Dogs came in? how they of some
Countries became depilous, and without any hair at all, whereas some
sorts in excess abound therewith? How the Indian Hare came to have a
long tail, whereas that part in others attains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span> no higher than a scut?
How the hogs of <i>Illyria</i> which <i>Aristotle</i> speaks of, became solipedes
or whole-hoofed, whereas in other parts they are bisulcous, and
described cloven-hoofed by God himself? All which with many others must
needs seem strange unto those that hold there were but two of the
unclean sort in the ark; and are forced to reduce these varieties to
unknown originals.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>How the complexion of the Negroes may be propagated.</i></div>

<p>However therefore this complexion was first acquired, it is evidently
maintained by generation, and by the tincture of the skin as a
spermatical part traduced from father unto Son; so that they which are
strangers contract it not, and the Natives which transmigrate, omit it
not without commixture, and that after divers generations. And this
affection (if the story were true) might wonderfully be confirmed, by
what <i>Maginus</i> and others relate of the Emperour of <i>√Üthiopia</i>, or
<i>Prester John</i>, who derived from <i>Solomon</i> is not yet descended into the
hue of his Country, but remains a <i>Mulatto</i>, that is, of a Mongril
complexion unto this day. Now although we conceive this blackness to be
seminal, yet are we not of <i>Herodotus</i> conceit, that their seed is
black. An opinion long ago rejected by <i>Aristotle</i>, and since by sense
and enquiry. His assertion against the Historian was probable, that all
seed was white; that is without great controversie in viviparous
Animals, and such as have Testicles, or preparing vessels wherein it
receives a manifest dealbation. And not only in them, but (for ought I
know) in Fishes not abating the seed of Plants; whereof at least in most
though the skin and covering be black, yet is the seed and fructifying
part not so; as may be observed in the seeds of <i>Onyons</i>, <i>Pyonie</i> and
<i>Basil</i>. Most controvertible it seems in the spawn of Frogs, and
Lobsters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span> whereof notwithstanding at the very first the spawn is white,
contracting by degrees a blackness, answerable in the one unto the
colour of the shell, in the other unto the Porwigle or Tadpole; that is
that Animall which first proceedeth from it. And thus may it also be in
the generation and sperm of Negroes; that being first and in its
naturals white, but upon separation of parts, accidents before invisible
become apparent; there arising a shadow or dark efflorescence in the
outside; whereby not only their legitimate and timely births, but their
abortions are also dusky, before they have felt the scorch and fervor of
the Sun.</p>

<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of the same.</span></h2>


<p>A Second opinion there is, that this complexion was first a curse of God
derived unto them from <i>Cham</i>, upon whom it was inflicted for
discovering the nakedness of <i>Noah</i>. Which notwithstanding is sooner
affirmed then proved, and carrieth with it sundry improbabilities. For
first, if we derive the curse on <i>Cham</i>, or in general upon his
posterity, we shall denigrate a greater part of the earth then was ever
so conceived; and not only paint the √Üthiopians and reputed sons of
<i>Cush</i>, but the people also of <i>Egypt</i>, <i>Arabia</i>, <i>Assyria</i> and
<i>Chaldea</i>; for by this race were these Countries also peopled. And if
concordantly unto <i>Berosus</i>, the fragment of <i>Cato de Originibus</i>, some
things of <i>Halicarnasseus</i>, <i>Macrobius</i>, and out of them of <i>Leandro</i>
and <i>Annius</i>, we shall conceive of the travels of <i>Camese</i> or <i>Cham</i>; we
may introduce a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span> generation of <i>Negroes</i> as high as <i>Italy</i>; which part
was never culpable of deformity, but hath produced the magnified
examples of beauty.</p>

<p>Secondly, The curse mentioned in Scripture was not denounced upon
<i>Cham</i>, but <i>Canaan</i> his youngest son, and the reasons thereof are
divers. The first, from the Jewish Tradition, whereby it is conceived
that <i>Canaan</i> made the discovery of the nakedness of <i>Noah</i>, and
notified it unto <i>Cham</i>. Secondly, to have cursed <i>Cham</i> had been to
curse all his posterity, whereof but one was guilty of the fact. And
lastly, he spared <i>Cham</i>, because he had blessed him before. <span class="sidenote10">Cap.
9.</span> Now if we confine this curse unto <i>Canaan</i>, and think the same
fulfilled in his posterity; then do we induce this complexion on the
Sidonians, then was the promised land a tract of Negroes; For from
<i>Canaan</i> were descended the <i>Canaanites</i>, <i>Jebusites</i>, <i>Amorites</i>,
<i>Gergazites</i> and <i>Hivites</i>, which were possessed of that land.</p>

<p>Thirdly, Although we should place the original of this curse upon one of
the sons of <i>Cham</i>, yet were it not known from which of them to derive
it. For the particularity of their descents is imperfectly set down by
accountants, nor is it distinctly determinable from whom thereof the
<i>√Üthiopians</i> are proceeded. For whereas these of <i>Africa</i> are generally
esteemed to be the Issue of <i>Chus</i>, the elder son of <i>Cham</i>, it is not
so easily made out. For the land of <i>Chus</i>, which the Septuagint
translates <i>√Üthiopia</i>, makes no part of <i>Africa</i>, nor is it the
habitation of Blackmores, but the Country of <i>Arabia</i>, especially the
Happy and Stony possessions and Colonies of all the sons of <i>Chus</i>,
excepting <i>Nimrod</i> and <i>Havilah</i>: possessed and planted wholly by the
children of <i>Chus</i>, that is, by <i>Sabtah</i> and <i>Raamah</i>, <i>Sabtacha</i>, and
the sons of <i>Raamah</i>, <i>Dedan</i>, and <i>Sheba</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span> according unto whose names
the Nations of those parts have received their denominations, as may be
collected from <i>Pliny</i> and <i>Ptolemy</i>; and as we are informed by credible
Authors, they hold a fair Analogy in their names, even unto our days. So
the wife of <i>Moses</i> translated in Scripture an <i>√Üthiopian</i>, and so
confirmed by the fabulous relation of <i>Josephus</i>, was none of the
daughters of <i>Africa</i>, nor any Negroe of <i>√Üthiopia</i>, but the daughter of
<i>Jethro</i>, Prince and Priest of <i>Madian</i>, which was a part of <i>Arabia</i>
the stony, bordering upon the Red Sea. So the Queen of <i>Sheba</i> came not
unto <i>Solomon</i> out of <i>√Üthiopia</i>, but from <i>Arabia</i>, and that part
thereof which bore the name of the first planter, the son of <i>Chus</i>. So
whether the Eunuch which <i>Philip</i> the Deacon baptised, were servant unto
<i>Candace</i> Queen of the <i>African √Üthiopia</i> (although <i>Damianus a Goes,
Codignus</i>, and the √Üthiopick relations averr) is yet by many, and with
strong suspitions doubted. So that Army of a million, which <i>Zerah</i> King
of <i>√Üthiopia</i> is said to bring against <i>Asa</i>, was drawn out of <i>Arabia</i>,
and the plantations of <i>Chus</i>; not out of <i>√Üthiopia</i>, and the remote
habitations of the Moors. For it is said that <i>Asa</i> pursuing his
victory, took from him the City <i>Gerar</i>; now <i>Gerar</i> was no City in or
near <i>√Üthiopia</i>, but a place between <i>Cadesh</i> and <i>Zur</i>, where <i>Abraham</i>
formerly sojourned. Since thereof these <i>African √Üthiopians</i> are not
convinced by the common acception to be the sons of <i>Chus</i>, whether they
be not the posterity of <i>Phut</i> or <i>Mizraim</i>, or both, it is not
assuredly determined. For <i>Mizraim</i>, he possessed <i>Egypt</i>, and the East
parts of <i>Africa</i>. From <i>Lubym</i> his son came the <i>Lybians</i>, and perhaps
from them the <i>√Üthiopians</i>. <i>Phut</i> possessed <i>Mauritania</i>, and the
Western parts of <i>Africa</i>, and from these perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span> descended the Moors
of the West, of <i>Mandinga</i>, <i>Meleguette</i> and <i>Guinie</i>. But from
<i>Canaan</i>, upon whom the curse was pronounced, none of these had their
originall; for he was restrained unto <i>Canaan</i> and <i>Syria</i>; although in
after Ages many Colonies dispersed, and some thereof upon the coasts of
<i>Africa</i>, and prepossessions of his elder brothers.</p>

<p>Fourthly, To take away all doubt or any probable divarication, the curse
is plainly specified in the Text, nor need we dispute it, like the mark
of <i>Cain</i>; <i>Servus servorum erit fratribus suis</i>, Cursed be <i>Canaan</i>, a
servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren; which was after
fulfilled in the conquest of <i>Canaan</i>, subdued by the <i>Israelites</i>, the
posterity of <i>Sem</i>. Which Prophecy <i>Abraham</i> well understanding, took an
oath of his servant not to take a wife for his son <i>Isaac</i> out of the
daughters of the <i>Canaanites</i>; and the like was performed by <i>Isaac</i> in
the behalf of his Son <i>Jacob</i>. As for <i>Cham</i> and his other sons, this
curse attained them not; for <i>Nimrod</i> the son of <i>Chus</i> set up his
kingdom in <i>Babylon</i>, and erected the first great Empire; <i>Mizraim</i> and
his posterity grew mighty Monarchs in <i>Egypt</i>; and the Empire of the
<i>√Üthiopians</i> hath been as large as either. Nor did the curse descend in
generall upon the posterity of <i>Canaan</i>: for the <i>Sidonians</i>, <i>Arkites</i>,
<i>Hamathites</i>, <i>Sinites</i>, <i>Arvadites</i>, and <i>Zemerites</i> seem exempted. But
why there being eleven Sons, five only were condemned and six escaped
the malediction, is a secret beyond discovery.</p>

<p>Lastly, Whereas men affirm this colour was a Curse, I cannot make out
the propriety of that name, it neither seeming so to them, nor
reasonably unto us; for they take so much content therein, that they
esteem deformity by other colours, describing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span> Devil, and terrible
objects, white. And if we seriously consult the definitions of beauty,
and exactly perpend what wise men determine thereof, we shall not
apprehend a curse, or any deformity therein. For first, some place the
essence thereof in the proportion of parts, conceiving it to consist in
a comely commensurability of the whole unto the parts, and the parts
between themselves: which is the determination of the best and learned
Writers. Now hereby the Moors are not excluded from beauty: there being
in this description no consideration of colours, but an apt connexion
and frame of parts and the whole. Others there be, and those most in
number, which place it not only in proportion of parts, but also in
grace of colour. But to make Colour essential unto Beauty, there will
arise no slender difficulty: For <i>Aristotle</i> in two definitions of
pulchritude, and <i>Galen</i> in one, have made no mention of colour. Neither
will it agree unto the Beauty of Animals: wherein notwithstanding there
is an approved pulchritude. Thus horses are handsome under any colour,
and the symmetry of parts obscures the consideration of complexions.
Thus in concolour animals and such as are confined unto one colour, we
measure not their Beauty thereby: For if a Crow or Black-bird grow
white, we generally account it more pretty; and in almost a monstrosity
descend not to opinion of deformity. By this way likewise the Moors
escape the curse of deformity: there concurring no stationary colour,
and sometimes not any unto Beauty.</p>

<p>The Platonick contemplators reject both these descriptions founded upon
parts and colours, or either: as <i>M. Leo</i> the Jew hath excellently
discoursed in his Genealogy of Love, defining beauty a formal grace,
which delights and moves them to love which compre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>hend it. This grace
say they, discoverable outwardly, is the resplendor and Ray of some
interiour and invisible Beauty, and proceedeth from the forms of
compositions amiable. Whose faculties if they can aptly contrive their
matter, they beget in the subject an agreeable and pleasing beauty; if
over-ruled thereby, they evidence not their perfections, but run into
deformity. For seeing that out of the same materials, <i>Thersites</i> and
<i>Paris</i>, Beauty and monstrosity may be contrived; the forms and
operative faculties introduce and determine their perfections. Which in
natural bodies receive exactness in every kind, according to the first
<i>Idea</i> of the Creator, and in contrived bodies the phancy of the
Artificer. And by this consideration of Beauty, the Moors also are not
excluded, but hold a common share therein with all mankind.</p>

<p>Lastly, In whatsoever its <i>Theory</i> consisteth, or if in the general, we
allow the common conceit of symmetry and of colour, yet to descend unto
singularities, or determine in what symmetry or colour it consisted,
were a slippery designation. For Beauty is determined by opinion, and
seems to have no essence that holds one notion with all; that seeming
beauteous unto one, which hath no favour with another; and that unto
every one, according as custome hath made it natural, or sympathy and
conformity of minds shall make it seem agreeable. Thus flat noses seem
comely unto the Moor, an Aquiline or hawked one unto the <i>Persian</i>, a
large and prominent nose unto the Romane; but none of all these are
acceptable in our opinion. Thus some think it most ornamental to wear
their Bracelets on their Wrests, others say it is better to have them
about their Ancles; some think it most comely to wear their Rings and
Jewels in the Ear, others will have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span> them about their Privities; a third
will not think they are compleat except they hang them in their lips,
cheeks, or noses. Thus <i>Homer</i> to set off <i>Minerva</i>, calleth her
Œ≥ŒªŒ±œÖŒ∫·ø∂œÄŒπœÇ, that is, gray or light-blew eyed: now this unto us seems far
less amiable then the black. Thus we that are of contrary complexions
accuse the blackness of the Moors as ugly: But the Spouse in the
<i>Canticles</i> excuseth this conceit, in that description of hers, I am
black, but comely. And howsoever <i>Cerberus</i>, and the furies of hell be
described by the Poets under this complexion, yet in the beauty of our
Saviour blackness is commended, when it is said, his locks are bushie
and black as a Raven. So that to inferr this as a curse, or to reason it
as a deformity, is no way reasonable; the two foundations of beauty,
Symmetry and complexion receiving such various apprehensions, that no
deviation will be expounded so high as a curse or undeniable deformity,
without a manifest and confessed degree of monstrosity.</p>

<p>Lastly, It is a very injurious method unto Philosophy, and a perpetual
promotion of ignorance, in points of obscurity; nor open unto easie
considerations, to fall upon a present refuge unto Miracles; or recurr
unto immediate contrivance, from the insearchable hands of God. Thus in
the conceit of the evil odor of the Jews, Christians without a further
research into the verity of the thing, or inquiry into the cause, draw
up a judgement upon them from the passion of their Saviour. Thus in the
wondrous effects of the clime of <i>Ireland</i>, and the freedom from all
venemous creatures, the credulity of common conceit imputes this
immunity unto the benediction of S. <i>Patrick</i>, as <i>Beda</i> and <i>Gyraldus</i>
have left recorded. Thus the Ass having a peculiar mark of a cross made
by a black list down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span> his back, and another athwart, or at right angles
down his shoulders; common opinion ascribes this figure unto a peculiar
signation; since that beast had the honour to bear our Saviour on his
back. Certainly this is a course more desperate then Antipathies,
Sympathies, or occult qualities; wherein by a final and satisfactive
discernment of faith, we lay the last and particular effects upon the
first and general cause of all things; whereas in the other, we do but
palliate our determinations, untill our advanced endeavours do totally
reject, or partially salve their evasions.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII_PE_VI" id="CHAPTER_XII_PE_VI">CHAPTER XII</a>
<br /><span class="subtitle90">A Digression concerning Blackness.</span></h2>


<p>There being therefore two opinions repugnant unto each other, it may not
be presumptive or skeptical to doubt of both. And because we remain
imperfect in the general Theory of colours, we shall deliver at present
a short discovery of blackness; wherein although perhaps we afford no
greater satisfaction then others, yet shall we Emperically and sensibly
discourse hereof; deducing the causes of Blackness from such Originals
in nature, as we do generally observe things are denigrated by Art. And
herein I hope our progression will not be thought unreasonable, for Art
being the imitation of Nature, or Nature at the second hand, it is but a
sensible expression of effects dependant on the same, though more
removed causes: and therefore the works of the one may serve to discover
the other. And though colours of bodies may arise according to the
receptions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span> refraction, or modification of Light; yet are there certain
materialls which may dispose them unto such qualities.</p>

<p>And first, Things become black by a sooty and fuliginous matter
proceeding from the Sulphur of bodies torrified; not taking <i>fuligo</i>
strictly, but in opposition unto ·ºÄœÑŒº·Ω∏œÇ, that is any kind of vaporous or
madefying excretion; and comprehending ·ºÄŒΩŒ±Œ∏œÖŒºŒØŒ±œÉŒπœÇ, that is as
<i>Aristotle</i> defines it, a separation of moist and dry parts made by the
action of heat or fire, and colouring bodies objected. Hereof in his
Meteors, from the qualities of the subject he raiseth three kinds; the
exhalations from ligneous and lean bodies, as bones, hair, and the like
he calleth Œ∫Œ¨œÄŒΩŒøœÇ, <i>fumus</i>, from fat bodies, and such as have not their
fatness conspicuous or separated he termeth ŒªŒØŒ≥ŒΩœÖœÇ, <i>fuligo</i>, as wax,
rosin, pitch, or turpentine; that from unctuous bodies, and such whose
oyliness is evident, he named Œ∫ŒΩŒØœÉŒ∑ or <i>nidor</i>. Now everyone of these do
black bodies objected unto them, and are to be conceived in the sooty
and fuliginous matter expressed.</p>

<p>I say, proceeding from the sulphur of bodies torrified, that is the
oylie fat, and unctuous parts wherein consist the principles of
flammability. Not pure and refined sulphur, as in the Spirits of wine
often rectified; but containing terrestrious parts, and carrying with it
the volatile salt of the body, and such as is distinguishable by taste
in soot; nor vulgar and usual sulphur, for that leaves none or very
little blackness, except a metalline body receive the exhalation.</p>

<p>I say, torrified, sindged, or suffering some impression from fire; thus
are bodies casually or artificially denigrated, which in their naturals
are of another complexion; thus are Charcoals made black by an
infection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span> of their own suffitus, so is it true what is affirmed of
combustible bodies. <i>Adusta nigra</i>, <i>perusta alba</i>; black at first from
the fuliginous tincture, which being exhaled they become white, as is
perceptible in ashes. And so doth fire cleanse and purifie bodies,
because it consumes the sulphureous parts, which before did make them
foul: and therefore refines those bodies which will never be mundified
by water. Thus Camphire of a white substance, by its <i>fuligo</i> affordeth
a deep black. So is pitch black, although it proceed from the same tree
with Rosin, the one distilling forth, the other forced by fire. So of
the suffitus of a torch, do Painters make a velvet black: so is
lamp-black made: so of burnt Harts-horn a sable; so is Bacon denigrated
in chimnies: so in Feavers and hot distempers from choler adust is
caused a blackness in our tongues, teeth and excretions: so are
ustilago, brant corn and trees black by blasting; so parts cauterized,
gangrenated, siderated and mortified, become black, the radical
moisture, or vital sulphur suffering an extinction, and smothered in the
part effected. So not only actual but potential fire: not burning fire,
but also corroding water will induce a blackness. <span class="sidenote"><i>Why the smoak of
pure Sulphur blacks not.</i></span> So are Chimnies and Furnaces generally black,
except they receive a clear and manifest sulphur: for the smoak of
sulphur will not black a paper, and is commonly used by women to whiten
Tiffinies, which it performeth by an acide vitriolous, and penetrating
spirit ascending from it, by reason whereof it is not apt to kindle any
thing nor will it easily light a Candle, untill that spirit be spent,
and the flame approacheth the match. This is that acide and piercing
spirit which with such activity and compunction invadeth the brains and
nostrils of those that receive it. And thus when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span> <i>Bellonius</i> affirmeth
that Charcoals made out of the wood of Oxycedar are white, Dr. <i>Jordan</i>
in his judicious Discourse of mineral waters yeeldeth the reason,
because their vapors are rather sulphureous then of any other
combustible substance. So we see that <i>Tinby</i> coals will not black
linnen being hanged in the smoak thereof, but rather whiten it, by
reason of the drying and penetrating quality of sulphur, which will make
Red roses white. And therefore to conceive a general blackness in Hell,
and yet therein the pure and refined flames of sulphur, is no
Philosophical conception, nor will it well consist with the real effects
of its nature.</p>

<p>These are the advenient and artificial wayes of denigration, answerably
whereto may be the natural progress. These are the wayes whereby
culinary and common fires do operate, and correspondent hereunto may be
the effects of fire elemental. So may Bitumen, Coals, Jet, Black-lead,
and divers mineral earths become black; being either fuliginous
concretions in the earth, or suffering a scorch from denigrating
Principles in their formation. So men and other animals receive
different tinctures from constitution and complexional efflorescences,
and descend still lower, as they partake of the fuliginous and
denigrating humour. And so may the <i>√Üthiopians</i> or <i>Negroes</i> become
coal-black, from fuliginous efflorescences and complexional tinctures
arising from such probabilities, as we have declared before.</p>

<p>The second way whereby bodies become black, is an Atramentous condition
or mixture, that is a vitriolate or copperose quality conjoyning with a
terrestrious and astringent humidity; for so is <i>Atramentum
Scriptorium</i>, or writing Ink commonly made by copperose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span> cast upon a
decoction or infusion of galls. I say a vitriolous or copperous quality;
for vitriol is the active or chief ingredient in Ink, and no other salt
that I know will strike the colour with galls; neither Alom, Sal-gem,
Nitre, nor Armoniack. <span class="sidenote"><i>What the common Copperose is.</i></span> Now
artificial copperose, and such as we commonly use, is a rough and
acrimonious kind of salt drawn out of ferreous and eruginous earths,
partaking chiefly of Iron and Copper; the blew of Copper, the green most
of Iron: Nor is it unusual to dissolve fragments of Iron in the liquor
thereof, for advantage in the concretion. I say, a terrestrious or
astringent humidity; for without this there will ensue no tincture; for
Copperose in a decoction of Lettuce or Mallows affords no black, which
with an astringent mixture it will do, though it be made up with oyl, as
in printing and painting Ink. But whereas in this composition we use
only Nut-gals, that is an excrescence from the Oak, therein we follow
and beat upon the old receit; for any plant of austere and stiptick
parts will suffice, as I have experimented in <i>Bistorte</i>, <i>Myrobolans</i>,
<i>Myrtus Brabantica</i>, <i>Balaustium</i> and Red Roses. And indeed, most
decoctions of astringent plants, of what colour soever, do leave in the
Liquor a deep and Muscadine red: which by addition of vitriol descends
into a black: and so <i>Dioscorides</i> in his receit of Ink, leaves out
gall, and with copperose makes use of soot.</p>

<p>Now if we enquire in what part of vitriol this Atramental and
denigrating condition lodgeth, it will seem especially to lie in the
more fixed salt thereof; for the phlegm or aqueous evaporation will not
denigrate; nor yet spirits of vitriol, which carry with them volatile
and nimbler Salt: For if upon a decoction of Copperose and gall, be
poured the spirits or oyl of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span> vitriol, the liquor will relinquish his
blackness; the gall and parts of the copperose precipitate unto the
bottom, and the Ink grow clear again; which it will not so easily do in
common Ink, because that gum is dissolved therein which hindereth the
separation. But Colcothar or vitriol burnt, though unto a redness
containing the fixed salt, will make good Ink; and so will the Lixivium,
or Lye made thereof with warm water; but the Terra or Insipid earth
remaining, affords no black at all, but serves in many things for a
gross and useful red. And though Spirits of vitriol, projected upon a
decoction of gals, will not raise a black, yet if these spirits be any
way fixed, or return into vitriol again, the same will act their former
parts and denigrate as before.</p>

<p>And if we yet make a more exact enquiry, by what this salt of vitriol
more peculiarly gives this colour, we shall find it to be from a
metalline condition, and especially an Iron Property or ferreous
participation. For blew Copperose which deeply partakes of the copper
will do it but weakly, Verdigrise which is made of Copper will not do it
at all, but the filings of Iron infused in vinegar, will with a
decoction of gals make good Ink, without any Copperose at all; and so
will infusion of Load-stone; which is of affinity with Iron. And though
more conspicuously in iron, yet such a Calcanthous or Atramentous
quality, we will not wholly reject in other mettals; whereby we often
observe black tinctures in their solutions. Thus a Lemmon, Quince or
sharp Apple cut with a knife becomes immediately black: And from the
like cause, Artichokes; so sublimate beat up with whites of eggs, if
touched with a knife, becomes incontinently black. So <i>Aqua fortis</i>,
whose ingredient is vitriol, will make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span> white bodies black. So leather
dressed with the bark of Oak, is easily made black by a bare solution of
Copperose. So divers Mineral waters and such as participate of Iron,
upon an infusion of gals, become of a dark colour, and entering upon
black. So steel infused, makes not only the liquor duskie, but in bodies
wherein it concurs with proportionable tinctures makes also the
excretions black. And so also from this vitriolous quality <i>Mercurius
dulcis</i>, and vitriol vomitive occasion black ejections. But whether this
denigrating quality in Copperose proceedeth from an Iron participation,
or rather in Iron from a vitriolous communication; or whether black
tinctures from metallical bodies be not from vitriolous parts contained
in their sulphur, since common sulphur containeth also much vitriol, may
admit consideration. However in this way of tincture, it seemeth plain,
that Iron and Vitriol are the powerful Denigrators.</p>

<p>Such a condition there is naturally in some living creatures. Thus that
black humour by <i>Aristotle</i> named Œ∏œåŒªos, and commonly translated
<i>Atramentum</i>, may be occasioned in the Cuttle-fish. Such a condition
there is naturally in some Plants, as Black-berries, Walnut-rinds,
Black-cherries; whereby they extinguish inflammations, corroborate the
stomack, and are esteemed specifical in the Epilepsie. Such an
atramentous condition there is to be found sometime in the blood, when
that which some call <i>Acetum</i>, others <i>Vitriolum</i>, concurs with parts
prepared for this tincture. And so from these conditions the Moors might
possibly become Negroes, receiving Atramentous impressions in some of
those wayes, whose possibility is by us declared.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>How a vitriolous quality may be in living bodies.</i></div>

<p>Nor is it strange that we affirm there are vitriolous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span> parts, qualities,
and even at some distance Vitriol it self in living bodies; for there is
a sower stiptick salt diffused through the Earth, which passing a
concoction in plants, becometh milder and more agreeable unto the sense,
and this is that vegetable vitriol, whereby divers plants contain a
gratefull sharpness, as Lemmons, Pomegranats, Cherries, or an austere
and inconcocted roughness, as Sloes, Medlars and Quinces. And that not
only vitriol is a cause of blackness, but that the salts of natural
bodies do carry a powerfull stroke in the tincture and vernish of all
things, we shall not deny, if we contradict not experience, and the
visible art of Dyars; who advance and graduate their colours with Salts.
For the decoctions of simples which bear the visible colours of bodies
decocted, are dead and evanid, without the commixtion of Alum, Argol,
and the like. And this is also apparent in Chymical preparations. So
Cinaber becomes red by the acide exhalation of sulphur, which otherwise
presents a pure and niveous white. So spirits of Salt upon a blew paper
make an orient red. So Tartar or vitriol upon an infusion of violets
affords a delightfull crimson. <span class="sidenote"><i>Whence the colours of Plants, etc.
may arise.</i></span> Thus it is wonderful what variety of colours the spirits of
Saltpeter, and especially, if they be kept in a glass while they pierce
the sides thereof; I say, what Orient greens they will project: from the
like spirits in the earth the plants thereof perhaps acquire their
verdure. And from such salary irradiations may those wondrous varieties
arise, which are observable in Animals, as Mallards heads, and Peacocks
feathers, receiving intention or alteration according as they are
presented unto the light. Thus Saltpeter, Ammoniack and Mineral spirits
emit delectable and various colours; and common <i>Aqua fortis</i> will in
some green and narrow mouthed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span> glasses, about the verges thereof, send
forth a deep and Gentianella blew.</p>

<p>Thus have we at last drawn our conjectures unto a period; wherein if our
contemplations afford no satisfaction unto others, I hope our attempts
will bring no condemnation on our selves (for besides that adventures in
knowledge are laudable, and the assayes of weaker heads afford
oftentimes improveable hints unto better) although in this long journey
we miss the intended end; yet are there many things of truth disclosed
by the way; and the collaterall verity may unto reasonable speculations
some what requite the capital indiscovery.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII_PE_VI" id="CHAPTER_XIII_PE_VI">CHAPTER XIII</a>
<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of Gypsies.</span></h2>


<p>Great wonder it is not we are to seek in the original of <i>√Üthiopians</i>
and natural Negroes, being also at a loss concerning the Original of
Gypsies and counterfeit Moors, observable in many parts of <i>Europe</i>,
<i>Asia</i>, and <i>Africa</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Opinions concerning the original of Gypsies.</i></div>

<p>Common opinion deriveth them from <i>Egypt</i>, and from thence they derive
themselves, according to their own account hereof, as <i>Munster</i>
discovered in the letters and pass which they obtained from <i>Sigismund</i>
the Emperour; that they first came out of lesser <i>Egypt</i>, that having
defected from the Christian rule, and relapsed unto Pagan rites, some of
every family were enjoyned this penance to wander about the world; or as
<i>Aventinus</i> delivereth, they pretend for this vagabond course, a
judgement of God upon their fore-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span> fathers, who refused to entertain the
Virgin <i>Mary</i> and Jesus, when she fled into their Country.</p>

<p>Which account notwithstanding is of little probability: for the generall
stream of writers, who enquire into their originall, insist not upon
this; and are so little satisfied in their descent from <i>Egypt</i>, that
they deduce them from several other nations: <span class="sidenote"><i>Fernand. de Cordua
didascal. multipl.</i></span> <i>Polydore Virgil</i> accounting them originally
<i>Syrians</i>, <i>Philippus Bergomas</i> fetcheth them from <i>Chald√¶a</i>, <i>√Üneas
Sylvius</i> from some part of <i>Tartary</i>, <i>Bellonius</i> no further then
<i>Walachia</i> and <i>Bulgaria</i>, nor <i>Aventinus</i> then the confines of
<i>Hungaria</i>.</p>

<p>That they are no <i>Egyptians</i>, <i>Bellonius</i><span class="sidenote15">Observat. l. 2.</span> maketh
evident: who met great droves of Gypsies in <i>Egypt</i>, about Gran Cairo,
Mat√¶rea, and the villages on the banks of <i>Nilus</i>, who notwithstanding
were accounted strangers unto that Nation, and wanderers from foreign
parts, even as they are esteemed with us.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Gypsies first known in Germany.</i></div>

<p>That they came not out of <i>Egypt</i> is also probable, because their first
appearance was in <i>Germany</i>, since the year 1400, nor were they observed
before in other parts of <i>Europe</i>, as is deducible from <i>Munster</i>,
<i>Genebrard</i>, <i>Crantsius</i> and <i>Ortilius</i>.</p>

<p>But that they first set out not far from <i>Germany</i>, is also probable
from their language, which was the Sclavonian tongue; and when they
wandred afterward into <i>France</i>, they were commonly called <i>Bohemians</i>,
which name is still retained for Gypsies. And therefore when <i>Crantsius</i>
delivereth, they first appeared about the Baltick Sea, when <i>Bellonius</i>
deriveth them from <i>Bulgaria</i> and <i>Walachia</i>, and others from about
<i>Hungaria</i>, they speak not repugnantly hereto: for the language of those
Nations was Sclavonian, at least some dialect thereof.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>What use the Grand Signior maketh of Gypsies.</i></div>

<p>But of what nation soever they were at first, they are now almost of
all; associating unto them some of every country where they wander: when
they will be lost, or whether at all again, is not without some doubt:
for unsetled nations have out-lasted others of fixed habitations: and
though Gypsies have been banished by most Christian Princes, yet have
they found some countenance from the great Turk, who suffereth them to
live and maintain publick Stews near the Imperial City in <i>Pera</i>,
<span class="sidenote">Bellon. observat. l. 2.</span> of whom he often maketh a politick advantage,
imploying them as spies into other nations, under which title they were
banished by <i>Charles</i> the fift.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV_PE_VI" id="CHAPTER_XIV_PE_VI">CHAPTER XIV</a>
<br /><span class="subtitle90">Of some others.</span></h2>


<p>We commonly accuse the phancies of elder times in the improper figures
of heaven assigned unto Constellations, which do not seem to answer
them, either in Greek or Barbarick Spheres: yet equall incongruities
have been commonly committed by Geographers and Historians, in the
figurall resemblances of several regions on earth; While by <i>Livy</i> and
<i>Julius, Rusticus</i> the Island of <i>Britain</i> is made to resemble a long
dish or two-edged ax; <i>Italy</i> by <i>Numatianus</i> to be like an Oak-leaf:
and <i>Spain</i> an Ox-hide; while the phancy of <i>Strabo</i> makes the habitated
earth like a cloak, and <i>Dionysius Afer</i> will have it like a sling: with
many others observable in good writers <span class="sidenote">Tacit. de vita Jul. Agric.</span>,
yet not made out from the letter or signification; acquitting Astronomy
in their figures of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span> Zodiack: wherein they are not justified unto
strict resemblances, but rather made out from the effects of Sun or Moon
in these several portions of heaven, or from peculiar influences of
those constellations, which some way make good their names.
<span class="sidenote">Junctin. in Sph. l. de Sacro bosco cap. 2.</span></p>

<p>Which notwithstanding being now authentick by prescription, may be
retained in their naked acceptions, and names translated from substances
known on earth. And therefore the learned <i>Hevelius</i> in his accurate
Selenography, or description of the Moon, hath well translated the known
appellations of Regions, Seas and Mountains, unto the parts of that
Luminary: and rather then use invented names or humane denominations,
with witty congruity hath placed <i>Mount Sinai</i>, <i>Taurus</i>, <i>M√¶otis
Palus</i>, the Mediterranean Sea, <i>Mauritania</i>, <i>Sicily</i> and <i>Asia</i> Minor
in the Moon.</p>

<p>More hardly can we find the Hebrew letters in the heavens, made out of
the greater and lesser Stars which put together do make up words,
wherein Cabalisticall Speculators conceive they read the events of
future things;<span class="sidenote"><i>The Cabala of the Stars.</i></span> and how from the Stars
in the head of <i>Medusa</i>, to make out the word <i>Charab</i>; and thereby
desolation presignified unto <i>Greece</i> or <i>Javan</i>, numerally
characterized in that word, requireth no rigid reader. <span class="sidenote">Greffarel
<i>out of R.</i> Chomer.</span></p>

<p>It is not easie to reconcile the different accounts of longitude, while
in modern tables the hundred and eighty degree is more then thirty
degrees beyond that part, where <i>Ptolomy</i> placeth an 180. Nor will the
wider and more Western term of Longitude, from whence the Moderns begin
their commensuration, sufficiently salve the difference. <span class="sidenote">Athan.
Kircher. in pro≈ìmio.</span> The ancients began the measure of Longitude
from the fortunate Islands or Canaries, the Moderns from the Azores or
Islands of S. <i>Michael</i>; but since the Azores are but fifteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span> degrees
more West, why the Moderns should reckon 180, where <i>Ptolomy</i> accounteth
above 220, or though they take in 15 degrees at the West, why they
should reckon 30 at the East, beyond the same measure, is yet to be
determined; nor would it be much advantaged, if we should conceive that
the compute of <i>Ptolomy</i> were not so agreeable unto the Canaries, as the
Hesperides or Islands of <i>Cabo Verde</i>. <span class="sidenote">Robertus Hues de globis.</span></p>

<p>Whether the compute of moneths from the first appearance of the Moon,
which divers nations have followed, be not a more perturbed way, then
that which accounts from the conjunction, may seem of reasonable doubt
<span class="sidenote">Hevel. Selenog. cap. 9.</span>; not only from the uncertainty of its
appearance in foul and cloudy weather, but unequal time in any; <span class="sidenote"><i>When the Moon will be seen on the first day of the change.</i></span> that is
sooner or later, according as the Moon shall be in the signs of long
descention, as <i>Pisces</i>, <i>Aries</i>, <i>Taurus</i>, in the Perigeum or swiftest
motion, and in the Northern Latitude: whereby sometimes it may be seen
the very day of the change, as will observably happen 1654, in the
moneths of April and May? or whether also the compute of the day be
exactly made, from the visible arising or setting of the Sun, because
the Sun is sometimes naturally set, and under the Horizon, when visibly
it is above it; <span class="sidenote"><i>Why the Sun is seen after it is set, or naturally under the Horizon.</i></span>
from the causes of refraction, and such as make us
behold a piece of silver in a basin, when water is put upon it, which we
could not discover before, as under the verge thereof.</p>

<p>Whether the globe of the earth be but a point, in respect of the Stars
and Firmament, or how if the rayes thereof do fall upon a point, they
are received in such variety of Angles, appearing greater or lesser from
differences of refraction?</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>To what the motion of the Heavens serveth</i>, Met. Lib.</div>

<p>Whether if the motion of the Heavens should cease<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span> a while, all things
would instantly perish? and whether this assertion doth not make the
frame of sublunary things to hold too loose a dependency upon the first
and conserving cause? at least impute too much unto the motion of the
heavens, whose eminent activities are by heat, light and influence, the
motion it self being barren, or chiefly serving for the due application
of celestial virtues unto sublunary bodies as <i>Cabeus</i> hath learnedly
observed?</p>

<p>Whether Comets or blazing Stars be generally of such terrible effects,
as elder times have conceived them; for since it is found that many,
from whence these predictions are drawn, have been above the Moon; why
they may not be qualified from their positions, and aspects which they
hold with stars of favourable natures; or why since they may be
conceived to arise from the effluviums of other Stars, they may not
retain the benignity of their Originals; or since the natures of the
fixed Stars are astrologically differenced by the Planets, and are
esteemed Martial or Jovial, according to the colours whereby they answer
these Planets; why although the red Comets do carry the portensions of
Mars, the brightly-white should not be of the Influence of Jupiter or
Venus, answerably unto <i>Cor Scorpii</i> and Arcturus, is not absurd to
doubt.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
